<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>

<p>CoreWeave’s Q2 print reinforced a dual narrative: execution at scale with improving unit economics, but a back-half ramp that leans heavily on the industry’s tightest bottlenecks. Revenue reached $1.21B with adjusted EBITDA of $753M, as management raised FY25 revenue guidance to $5.15–$5.35B and reiterated a Q4‑weighted CapEx plan of $20–$23B to push active power from ~470 MW to “over 900 MW” by year‑end. Management squarely attributes supply tightness to “powered shells” and grid/gear constraints, not GPUs, and flagged that costs hit P&amp;L before revenue as sites are readied—making the energization cadence pivotal to Q4 delivery. Investors should assume material schedule risk from utility interconnections, MV gear and liquid‑cooling commissioning, with no publicly posted energization letters for H2 sites as of the call. Any 4–12 week slippage would defer revenue even as pre‑revenue lease costs rise. <a href="#post-56">[56]</a> <a href="#post-52">[52]</a> <a href="#post-14">[14]</a> <a href="#post-72">[72]</a> <a href="#post-89">[89]</a></p>

<p>On financing, CoreWeave materially reset its cost of capital: a fully underwritten $2.6B DDTL at SOFR+400 compares favorably to prior facilities, alongside $3.75B of fixed‑rate notes—setting up immediate interest savings if policy rates ease and extending the liability ladder with no parent‑level maturities until 2028. That plays directly into the verticalization story: the Core Scientific deal is pitched to eliminate &gt;$10B of future lease overhead and deliver “&gt;$500M” run‑rate savings by 2027, improving ROIC and accelerating EBITDA‑to‑FCF conversion—if it closes on time. The counterweight is that CoreWeave’s covenant framework and liquidity are now more sensitive to backlog quality and timing; the company reports $30.1B of RPO with only 50% expected to recognize within 24 months (down from 58% in Q1), while disclosures indicate some headline agreements are “up to” volumes subject to delivery/availability, and DDTL tests include a Contract Realization Ratio ≥0.85x starting 2027. <a href="#post-87">[87]</a> <a href="#post-92">[92]</a> <a href="#post-102">[102]</a> <a href="#post-82">[82]</a> <a href="#post-73">[73]</a> <a href="#post-131">[131]</a> <a href="#post-140">[140]</a> <a href="#post-129">[129]</a> <a href="#post-124">[124]</a></p>

<p>Regulatory and permitting uncertainties are non‑trivial. The Core Scientific acquisition could attract an FTC/DOJ Second Request given aggregation of scarce “AI‑ready” power; as of Aug 14 there was no public HSR status update—pushing potential synergy realization rightward if review drags. At the site level, Lancaster (PA) and Kenilworth (NJ) appear exposed to interconnection, tariff, air‑permit and environmental‑justice scrutiny with key approvals/permits not publicly confirmed; absence of utility energization letters amplifies timing risk. Layered on top are unpriced sustainability exposures: CoreWeave has not published companywide Scope 2 totals or site‑level 24/7 CFE procurements, implying higher emissions on fossil‑heavy grids and potential investor/policy pressure; power‑price hedging and pass‑through mechanics also remain undisclosed, leaving gross margins exposed to LMP/capacity volatility even as water‑usage risks may be partly mitigated by air‑cooled designs at select sites. <a href="#post-74">[74]</a> <a href="#post-88">[88]</a> <a href="#post-75">[75]</a> <a href="#post-97">[97]</a> <a href="#post-84">[84]</a> <a href="#post-89">[89]</a> <a href="#post-83">[83]</a> <a href="#post-90">[90]</a> <a href="#post-77">[77]</a> <a href="#post-138">[138]</a> <a href="#post-135">[135]</a></p>

<p>Operationally, the platform thesis is strengthening but has guardrails. Integration of Mission Control with W&amp;B and Slurm‑on‑Kubernetes aims to lift utilization and speed enterprise onboarding; storage/backbone diversification should de‑risk scale‑outs and improve GPU “goodput,” while recontracting A100/H100 clusters into 1–3‑year inference deals extends asset life and cushions obsolescence. Offsetting that, NVL72 topology imposes real limits on training‑to‑inference fungibility, and CoreWeave publishes no preemption/isolation SLOs—heightening perceived rationing risk as step‑function training loads coexist with reserved inference. Introduction of a spot product (in preview) may help seed the developer funnel, but it also adds a policy choice about who gets capacity in a structurally constrained system. Finally, customer concentration is extreme—Top‑1 accounted for 71% of Q2 revenue, with 89% of A/R in the top three—so any acceptance or payment timing variance from key counterparties can reverberate through DSOs, cash interest, and covenant headroom. <a href="#post-76">[76]</a> <a href="#post-130">[130]</a> <a href="#post-134">[134]</a> <a href="#post-94">[94]</a> <a href="#post-98">[98]</a> <a href="#post-91">[91]</a> <a href="#post-37">[37]</a> <a href="#post-78">[78]</a> <a href="#post-137">[137]</a> <a href="#post-128">[128]</a> <a href="#post-144">[144]</a></p>

<h2 id="infrastructure-scaling--power-bottlenecks">Infrastructure Scaling &amp; Power Bottlenecks</h2>

<p>CoreWeave’s back‑half plan pivots on turning “contracted power” into energized, revenue‑bearing capacity. Management aims to lift active power from ~470 MW to “over 900 MW” by year‑end, while acknowledging the ramp is Q4‑weighted and that costs (leases, site opex) hit before revenue when sites are staged. They explicitly identify “powered shells” and grid gear as today’s choke point rather than GPUs. With no publicly posted utility energization letters for H2 sites, the energization/commissioning cadence is the critical path for Q4 delivery and for avoiding a cost‑before‑revenue squeeze. <a href="#post-52">[52]</a> <a href="#post-53">[53]</a> <a href="#post-14">[14]</a> <a href="#post-89">[89]</a></p>

<p>Two countervailing forces shape the risk: on one side, utilities/interconnects, MV gear, and liquid‑cooling readiness (for NVL72/GB200) can slip schedules and limit parallel commissioning; on the other, verticalization (Core Scientific) and multi‑vendor storage/backbone strategies are designed to shorten regulatory/gear critical paths and keep GPU clusters from sitting idle due to single‑vendor bottlenecks. The system is still structurally supply‑constrained, which can cascade into workload rationing if training surges collide with inference reservations. <a href="#post-72">[72]</a> <a href="#post-130">[130]</a> <a href="#post-73">[73]</a> <a href="#post-78">[78]</a></p>

  <p>The Q4 backloaded leap from ~470MW to &gt;900MW hinges on energizing powered shells—the acknowledged choke point—and can slip 4–12 weeks because utilities delay interconnection, MV transformer/switchgear arrive late, and liquid-cooling (GB200/NVL72) complicates IST/SAT; delays defer revenue despite rising lease expense. Also scarce HV electricians/TAB crews limit parallel commissioning throughput. — Cloud Operations Manager; Support: 2 <a href="#post-72">[72]</a></p>

<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>

<p>Consensus holds that the grid–shell interface—not GPUs—is the gating item for CoreWeave’s Q4 ramp, with real‑world frictions (utility interconnects, MV gear, liquid‑cooling commissioning, specialist labor) threatening 4–12 week slips that would defer revenue while fixed costs accrue. Management’s own guidance reinforces a back‑loaded energization profile and cost‑before‑revenue dynamics, heightening sensitivity to any energization delay. Mitigations exist—verticalizing power shells via the Core Scientific deal and diversifying storage/backbone vendors to avoid single‑point bottlenecks—but until energization letters and site‑level schedules are public, the primary uncertainty remains the utility/commissioning critical path and how effectively CoreWeave can translate contracted power into energized, revenue‑generating megawatts at the promised pace. <a href="#post-52">[52]</a> <a href="#post-53">[53]</a> <a href="#post-14">[14]</a> <a href="#post-72">[72]</a> <a href="#post-130">[130]</a> <a href="#post-73">[73]</a> <a href="#post-89">[89]</a></p>

<h2 id="capital-structure-backlog-integrity--liquidity">Capital Structure, Backlog Integrity &amp; Liquidity</h2>

<p>A capital-intensive, back‑loaded build and large, concentrated customer contracts make capital structure, backlog integrity, and liquidity the fulcrum for CoreWeave’s FY25 delivery. Management reset its cost of capital with a fully underwritten SOFR+400 delayed‑draw term loan maturing 2030 and added $3.75B in fixed‑rate notes, leaving no parent‑level maturities until 2028 and pushing DSCR testing to 2027—creating sensitivity to the rate path but also giving time for RPO to convert before major tests and maturities hit. <a href="#post-87">[87]</a> <a href="#post-92">[92]</a> <a href="#post-102">[102]</a> <a href="#post-150">[150]</a></p>

<p>Counterbalancing the improved liability ladder are backlog‑quality and concentration risks. RPO reached $30.1B, but only 50% is expected to be recognized within 24 months (down from 58% in Q1), and prior disclosures show portions of headline deals framed as “up to” volumes subject to delivery/availability, while the new covenant framework includes a Contract Realization Ratio ≥0.85x beginning in 2027. Q2 revenue was highly concentrated (Top‑1 = 71% of revenue; A/R 89% in top‑3), amplifying working‑capital and covenant exposure if acceptance or payment timing slips. <a href="#post-140">[140]</a> <a href="#post-129">[129]</a> <a href="#post-124">[124]</a> <a href="#post-128">[128]</a> <a href="#post-137">[137]</a> <a href="#post-144">[144]</a> Meanwhile, management guided Q3 interest expense to $350–$390M, underscoring the earnings sensitivity to financing costs while the balance sheet scales. <a href="#post-114">[114]</a></p>

<h3 id="analysis-1">Analysis</h3>
<p>The dominant views bifurcate: a stronger balance sheet and rate tailwinds versus vulnerabilities in backlog quality and extreme customer concentration that could pressure DSOs, liquidity draws, and covenant headroom. The dissent emphasizes sequencing advantages—RPO recognition and no maturities until 2028/DSCR not tested until 2027—plus operational levers (legacy GPU recontracting) that cushion cash generation. Key uncertainties are the true non‑cancellable share of backlog, timing of revenue conversion (with the 24‑month share declining), the floating‑rate mix and absence of disclosed hedges, and how any acceptance/payment slippage from top customers would flow through cash interest and Contract Realization tests. <a href="#post-129">[129]</a> <a href="#post-140">[140]</a> <a href="#post-92">[92]</a> <a href="#post-144">[144]</a></p>

<h2 id="regulatory-compliance--antitrust-risk">Regulatory Compliance &amp; Antitrust Risk</h2>

<p>Regulatory exposure is now a core execution variable for both the M&amp;A thesis and the H2–Q4 capacity ramp. The proposed all‑stock acquisition of Core Scientific concentrates scarce, “AI‑ready” power under a fast‑growing AI cloud, which could invite antitrust scrutiny and elongate the closing timeline—directly affecting the timing of the touted synergy run‑rate. At the same time, site‑level permitting and interconnection risks at Lancaster (PA) and Kenilworth (NJ)—including PJM upgrades, state tariff scrutiny, air permits and potential environmental‑justice review—can impact energization schedules that underpin Q4 revenue conversion. <a href="#post-74">[74]</a> <a href="#post-75">[75]</a></p>

<p>Beyond U.S. antitrust and local siting rules, EU digital‑infrastructure regimes introduce additional compliance vectors. The EU Data Act’s switching/egress rules and possible NIS2/DORA oversight for financial‑sector workloads could impose contract and operational changes that affect procurement timing and margins. As of August 14, 2025, there is no public confirmation of HSR status on the Core Scientific deal, and CoreWeave has not publicly declared NIS2/DORA readiness, elevating disclosure‑timing risk around these areas. <a href="#post-88">[88]</a> <a href="#post-132">[132]</a> <a href="#post-127">[127]</a></p>

<h3 id="analysis-2">Analysis</h3>
<p>The dominant view is that regulatory processes pose tangible timing risk on two fronts: antitrust review of Core Scientific and site‑level permitting/interconnection for H2–Q4 activations. Uncertainties include whether the DOJ/FTC issues a Second Request (no public HSR update yet), the pace and conditions of PJM/utility approvals and air permits (particularly under NJ EJ rules), and EU compliance adjustments under the Data Act and potential NIS2/DORA oversight. Investors should watch for: formal HSR status updates, published permit IDs/approvals for Lancaster/Kenilworth, and EU terms/compliance roadmaps—each is a gating item for synergy capture and backlog‑to‑revenue conversion. <a href="#post-88">[88]</a> <a href="#post-75">[75]</a> <a href="#post-116">[116]</a> <a href="#post-132">[132]</a> <a href="#post-127">[127]</a></p>

<h2 id="operational-efficiency-through-technology-stack">Operational Efficiency Through Technology Stack</h2>

<p>CoreWeave’s stack-level bets aim to convert scarce physical resources into “virtual megawatts” through better scheduling, storage/backbone design, and developer-facing integrations. Management and several specialists argue that Mission Control plus W&amp;B/Weave and Slurm-on‑Kubernetes can lift utilization and goodput, while deep storage integrations and a private backbone reduce tail-latency stalls and stranded capacity—key in a supply‑constrained market where energization is the bottleneck. <a href="#post-76">[76]</a> <a href="#post-134">[134]</a> <a href="#post-130">[130]</a></p>

<p>The strategy also targets faster enterprise onboarding and multi‑product attach: a learning‑friendly stack reduces ML‑ops friction, potentially accelerating proof‑of‑concept to production and improving backlog conversion. However, dissenters note that practical “fungibility” is bounded—NVL72 topology can fragment inference capacity, and the absence of public preemption/isolation SLOs compounds perceived rationing risk. Public disclosures likewise lack third‑party verification isolating the stack’s quantitative impact on efficiency, leaving realized gains an empirical question. <a href="#post-81">[81]</a> <a href="#post-98">[98]</a> <a href="#post-91">[91]</a> <a href="#post-86">[86]</a></p>

The counterpoint argues “fungibility” is limited by NVL72 topology and policy choices: without published preemption/isolation SLOs, step‑function training can crowd out reserved inference, undermining perceived efficiency.

<p>Environmental factors now sit on CoreWeave’s execution path as directly as power and capital: the company has not published site‑level 24/7 carbon‑free energy (CFE) procurements or consolidated Scope 2 figures, leaving investors to infer emissions from grid mix at a time when contracted power and planned activations are large. In parallel, water and air‑permitting exposures at new mega‑sites (Lancaster, PA; Kenilworth, NJ) remain opaque in public records, while operator PUE/WUE claims at partner facilities have not been tied to CoreWeave‑specific deployments. These disclosure gaps—combined with potential policy pass‑throughs and permit timing—create ESG‑linked cost and schedule risk even if technical execution remains strong. <a href="#post-117">[117]</a> <a href="#post-83">[83]</a> <a href="#post-90">[90]</a> <a href="#post-149">[149]</a></p>

<p>The dominant perspectives cluster around three risks: carbon and disclosure (no published 24/7 CFE coverage or market‑based Scope 2 totals), water and local permitting (no posted water or air‑permit specifics for key sites), and power‑price volatility (no disclosed hedges or pass‑through/indexation). Some site‑level commentary suggests water risk is lower where air‑cooled designs are used, but this has not been verified company‑wide and does not resolve carbon or power‑price exposure. <a href="#post-120">[120]</a> <a href="#post-122">[122]</a> <a href="#post-138">[138]</a> <a href="#post-135">[135]</a></p>

<p>Consensus centers on ESG opacity as a material risk vector: absent site‑level 24/7 CFE and Scope 2 reporting, investors must assume higher effective emissions on fossil‑leaning grids with potential policy cost pass‑throughs; water and air‑permit details are likewise undisclosed at key sites, keeping local‑impact and schedule risk unresolved. While some public materials suggest air‑cooled designs at select locations and low‑WUE partner facilities, these claims are not verified company‑wide or tied to CoreWeave‑specific deployments. Key uncertainties are whether CoreWeave will publish site‑level CFE PPAs and Scope 2 methodology, obtain/ disclose water and air‑permit specifics (including EJ implications in NJ), and mitigate power‑price exposure via hedging or contract indexation. Watch for: 24/7 CFE disclosures and PPAs by site, permit IDs/conditions for backup generation and water use, and any stated power‑hedge or pass‑through mechanics; absent these, emissions and power volatility could inflate opex and reputational risk as scale grows. <a href="#post-77">[77]</a> <a href="#post-90">[90]</a> <a href="#post-99">[99]</a> <a href="#post-135">[135]</a> <a href="#post-149">[149]</a> <a href="#post-147">[147]</a></p>

<h2 id="customer-concentration--market-demand-management">Customer Concentration &amp; Market Demand Management</h2>

<p>Customer concentration and the mechanics of allocating scarce capacity are central to the near‑term thesis. CoreWeave’s topline is heavily levered to a single counterparty while its environment remains structurally supply‑constrained; that creates a tight coupling between a few customers’ acceptance/payment timing and CoreWeave’s ability to keep inference SLOs and ramp new logos. Management says training vs. inference unit economics are broadly similar, which eases headline mix risk, but the operational challenge is ensuring reserved inference isn’t crowded out by step‑function training spikes when powered shells are the choke point. Mitigants include recontracting older GPUs into multi‑year inference, building a developer funnel via on‑demand/spot plus W&amp;B tooling, and offering dedicated clusters/VPC isolation—yet CoreWeave has not published preemption/isolation SLOs or historical adherence metrics, and it hasn’t disclosed a training–inference revenue split.</p>

<p>The crux for investors: concentration amplifies working‑capital and covenant sensitivity, while demand management policy (reservation, preemption, slicing) affects perceived reliability for enterprises. The upside case leans on lifecycle demand smoothing (A100/H100 recontracting) and a product‑led funnel to diversify mix; the downside case is that rationing risk and acceptance/payment slippage from top accounts can ripple into DSOs, interest costs, and backlog realization.</p>

<p>Most specialists converge on two risks: extreme revenue/A/R concentration and structural capacity rationing, with absent public preemption/isolation SLOs heightening enterprise concern.

<h2 id="emerging-clusters--factions">Emerging Clusters &amp; Factions</h2>

<p>Six distinct clusters emerged, splitting broadly between growth/verticalization optimists and execution-risk realists. The debate centered on whether CoreWeave’s capital and platform advantages can overcome structural power bottlenecks, regulatory drag, and concentration/ESG exposures—and on how much “virtual capacity” software can unlock in a grid‑constrained world.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Powered shells—not GPUs—are the current choke point; Q4’s back‑loaded leap from ~470 MW to &gt;900 MW is vulnerable to 4–12 week slips from interconnection delays, MV transformer/switchgear logistics, and liquid‑cooling commissioning for NVL72/GB200; specialist labor (HV electricians/TAB) limits parallel IST/SAT throughput <a href="#post-14">[14]</a> <a href="#post-52">[52]</a> <a href="#post-72">[72]</a>.</li>
  <li>With no public H2 energization letters, schedule risk is elevated; multi‑vendor storage/backbone can shorten non‑power critical paths and prevent cluster idling, but utility energization remains the gating item <a href="#post-89">[89]</a> <a href="#post-130">[130]</a>.</li>

<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>

<p>Widely Supported</p>
<ul>
  <li>Require site‑level proof before underwriting the Q4 ramp – request utility energization letters and IST/SAT commissioning schedules for all H2‑2025 activations; if unavailable, model 4–12 week slip scenarios and defer revenue while lease/site opex continues to hit P&amp;L. <a href="#post-52">[52]</a> <a href="#post-72">[72]</a> <a href="#post-89">[89]</a></li>
  <li>Align models to “cost‑before‑revenue” dynamics in H2 – management flagged back‑loaded energization and pre‑revenue costs (leases, ops) as capacity is staged; keep Q3 margins conservative and avoid pulling forward Q4 revenue absent energization evidence. <a href="#post-53">[53]</a> <a href="#post-52">[52]</a> <a href="#post-56">[56]</a></li>
  <li>Underwrite antitrust timing risk on Core Scientific – track HSR status and plan for closing‑delay scenarios; treat “&gt;$500M” 2027 synergy and &gt;$10B lease‑overhead removal as timing‑contingent until clearance is confirmed. <a href="#post-74">[74]</a> <a href="#post-88">[88]</a> <a href="#post-82">[82]</a></li>
  <li>Scrutinize backlog quality and timing – distinguish non‑cancellable RPO vs “up to” volumes subject to delivery/availability; note only 50% of $30.1B is slated within 24 months (down from 58% in Q1); map downside if Contract Realization ≥0.85x is pressured in 2027. <a href="#post-129">[129]</a> <a href="#post-140">[140]</a> <a href="#post-124">[124]</a> <a href="#post-92">[92]</a></li>
  <li>Build working‑capital stress tests around concentration – Top‑1 was 71% of Q2 revenue and A/R was 89% in top‑3; terms are “generally within 60 days” but can be up to 360; absence of DSO disclosure warrants conservative DSO/collections scenarios and cash‑interest draw sensitivity. <a href="#post-128">[128]</a> <a href="#post-137">[137]</a> <a href="#post-144">[144]</a></li>
  <li>Map interest‑rate exposure and covenant runway – quantify fixed vs floating using disclosures (SOFR+400 DDTL3; 2030 notes), apply the stated 100 bps sensitivity, and recognize DSCR/Contract Realization tests start 2027; rate cuts are an identifiable upside while hedging is undisclosed. <a href="#post-87">[87]</a> <a href="#post-92">[92]</a> <a href="#post-114">[114]</a> <a href="#post-102">[102]</a></li>
  <li>Price power‑cost volatility into margins – no disclosed power hedges or compute‑contract pass‑through/indexation; run LMP/capacity/ancillary shock scenarios across PJM/ERCOT/TVA footprints when assessing gross‑margin and DSCR headroom. <a href="#post-138">[138]</a> <a href="#post-147">[147]</a></li>
  <li>Protect enterprise inference assumptions – there are no public preemption/isolation SLOs, and rationing risk is flagged in a supply‑constrained system; require contractual isolation or historic adherence evidence for reserved inference when underwriting enterprise ramp/SLOs. <a href="#post-78">[78]</a> <a href="#post-91">[91]</a> <a href="#post-126">[126]</a></li>
  <li>Treat Lancaster (PA) and Kenilworth (NJ) energization as permitting‑contingent – actively track PJM interconnection/utility upgrades, NJ BPU/PA PUC tariff scrutiny, and NJDEP/PADEP air/water permits (including EJ review in NJ); absence of permit IDs/approvals should keep schedule risk elevated. <a href="#post-75">[75]</a> <a href="#post-84">[84]</a> <a href="#post-97">[97]</a> <a href="#post-122">[122]</a> <a href="#post-112">[112]</a> <a href="#post-113">[113]</a></li>
  <li>Apply an ESG disclosure discount until clarified – CoreWeave has not published consolidated Scope 2 totals or site‑level 24/7 CFE PPAs for Lancaster/Kenilworth; assume higher effective emissions and potential policy cost pass‑throughs until site‑level CFE and methodology are disclosed. <a href="#post-83">[83]</a> <a href="#post-117">[117]</a> <a href="#post-120">[120]</a> <a href="#post-90">[90]</a> <a href="#post-77">[77]</a></li>
  <li>Give guarded credit to legacy‑GPU recontracting – management and filings indicate A100/H100 clusters are being recontracted for 1–3 years (plus OpenAI’s 5+1+1), extending asset life; ask for utilization evidence to size the benefit and avoid over‑crediting in cash‑flow models. <a href="#post-48">[48]</a> <a href="#post-94">[94]</a> <a href="#post-101">[101]</a> <a href="#post-111">[111]</a></li>
  <li>Monitor storage/backbone as a commissioning mitigant – multi‑vendor storage and a private backbone reduce single‑vendor gating; maintain a watch for any H2 site deferrals attributed to storage/backbone to reassess readiness risk. <a href="#post-130">[130]</a> <a href="#post-145">[145]</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Experimental / Watch-list</p>
<ul>
  <li>Treat “virtual megawatts” as upside optionality – Mission Control + W&amp;B/Weave + Slurm‑on‑K8s may lift utilization, but company‑wide, independently verified gains are not public; ask for quantified fleet‑level improvement before embedding in base cases. <a href="#post-76">[76]</a> <a href="#post-86">[86]</a> <a href="#post-81">[81]</a></li>
  <li>Watch NVL72 inference‑slicing efficiency – topology constraints can strand capacity; use NVL72 inference efficiency as a downside indicator if slicing falls short of expectations. <a href="#post-98">[98]</a></li>
  <li>Track EU regulatory deliverables – expect EU Data Act switching/egress changes by Sept 12, 2025; lack of a published roadmap and potential NIS2/DORA obligations may add procurement friction and margin pressure through 2027; monitor T&amp;Cs and audit/incident commitments. <a href="#post-132">[132]</a> <a href="#post-146">[146]</a> <a href="#post-127">[127]</a></li>
  <li>Validate verticalization speed via interconnection transferability – synergy and time‑to‑power depend on whether Core Scientific interconnection agreements can be assigned without queue re‑entry; review S‑4/exhibits when filed. <a href="#post-108">[108]</a> <a href="#post-96">[96]</a></li>
  <li>Seek site‑level 24/7 CFE specifics and verification – watch for PPAs/REC volumes, hourly matching percentages, tenors, and any third‑party verification for Lancaster/Kenilworth before assuming carbon‑intensity improvements. <a href="#post-117">[117]</a> <a href="#post-121">[121]</a> <a href="#post-123">[123]</a></li>
  <li>Keep water‑use risk on the radar – Lancaster is “primarily air‑cooled” and partner sites tout low WUE, but tenant‑level WUE/permit MGD is not published; treat as unresolved until permits or measured WUE are disclosed. <a href="#post-112">[112]</a> <a href="#post-135">[135]</a> <a href="#post-149">[149]</a> <a href="#post-99">[99]</a></li>
  <li>Watch for mix disclosure – training vs inference revenue split is not reported; management says economics are broadly similar, but mix transparency would reduce modeling uncertainty. <a href="#post-109">[109]</a> <a href="#post-35">[35]</a></li>

[1] <strong>Tina, Conference Operator</strong> Tina, Conference Operator: Thank you for standing by. My name is Tina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CoreWeave Second Quarter twenty twenty five Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question and answer session. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Deborah Crawford, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.</p>

<p><a id="post-2"></a>
[2] <strong>Deborah Crawford, Vice President of Investor Relations, CoreWeave</strong> Deborah Crawford, Vice President of Investor Relations, CoreWeave: we can go to the next question and then we can come back.</p>

<p><a id="post-3"></a>
[3] <strong>Tina, Conference Operator</strong> Tina, Conference Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-4"></a>
[4] <strong>Kash Rangan, Analyst, Goldman Sachs</strong> Kash Rangan, Analyst, Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much. Congrats on a really spectacular finish to second quarter. I’m wondering if you could talk about the renewal of the hyperscaler contracts. I think one of the two is a particularly larger one. And I’m curious to see if this means that you have greater confidence that they will renew, not just expand the interim motion, but how is it more likely that they renew the big contract that they first signed with you in 2024? And one thing for Nitin, how</p>

<p><a id="post-5"></a>
[5] <strong>Tina, Conference Operator</strong> Tina, Conference Operator: do</p>

<p><a id="post-6"></a>
[6] <strong>Kash Rangan, Analyst, Goldman Sachs</strong> Kash Rangan, Analyst, Goldman Sachs: you look at the tweaks that you can put into the business to achieve even better return on assets as the company continues to lower its cost of capital? When you look at the core deployment model, maybe that has something to do with how quickly you can actually get the bookings into revenue. Clearly, you saw upside in the quarter on that front. But what are the things that the company has uncovered to continue to give you conviction that the company can earn a higher and higher rate of return on your capital going forward as it translates into revenue line item? Thank you so much.</p>

<p><a id="post-7"></a>
[7] <strong>Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave</strong> Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave: Thank you, Kash. And I appreciate the the comments on the second quarter. We’re really excited about how we’ve closed out the first half of the year. When when we think about contracts with our hyperscaler clients, for that matter, really, with any of our clients, we generally don’t focus on the concept of renewals. We focus on the concept of expansion. And the reason that we focus on the concept of expansion is because, generally speaking, the the the clients are purchasing hardware that is appropriately state of the art for their use case. And as new hardware comes out, as new hardware architectures are released, they tend to come back in and purchase the same top tier infrastructure in their next renewal. And so we’re excited about renewals when we get them with our hyperscale clients. We’re we’re excited about the renewals that we get with any of our clients across the board.</p>

<p><a id="post-8"></a>
[8] <strong>Nitin Agarwal, CFO, CoreWeave</strong> Nitin Agarwal, CFO, CoreWeave: Thanks, Mike. And, Kash, to second part of your question, there are a few things that we are already executing on. You know, you’ve seen us kind of acquire weights and biases, which is our attempt to go up stack and deliver more value added services for our customers. You’ve seen us with our proposed acquisition of going down the stack and verticalizing and continuing to get cost savings. We’ve talked about the anticipated fully ramped $500,000,000 by the 2025 in terms of savings. In addition to that, we also talked about how we continue to scale rapidly for our customers and continue to reduce the time from when we start deployment to when customers go online. In addition, we remain cost conscious and disciplined across every vector in our business as we continue to scale this business at an unprecedented rate. All of those factors are working great for us and we continue to deliver great results for the company.</p>

The earnings press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investors.corweave.com. A replay of this call will also be available on our Investor Relations website. And now I’d like to turn the call over to Mike.</p>

<p><a id="post-13"></a>
[13] <strong>Keith Weiss, Analyst, Morgan Stanley</strong> So great to see. I wanted to ask one question on the kind of demand side of the equation, one on the supply side of the equation. On the demand side of the equation, I think a lot of investors have the impression that CoreRev is handling a lot of training revenues. But a lot of the stuff that, Mike, you were talking to in terms of what you guys are doing with the software as well as the customers coming in the door speak to doing more inference, more applications being built on the platform. So can you talk to us a little bit about sort of the mix of business that you’re seeing and also the fungibility of the platform, the ability to handle both the pre training and the inference workloads over time? Then on the supply side of the equation, you talked about being supply constrained. Can you give us some sense of where the most acute supply challenges are? Is it on the chip level? Is it on the power level? Where do you guys expect to see those constraints in the near term? And how much of that can you guys work against? Like is there any fungibility of where you could more quickly or where would it take longer to solve those supply constraints?</p>

<p><a id="post-14"></a>
[14] <strong>Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave</strong> Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave: Sure. Thank you for the question. Let me let me, start off with, some comments around our infrastructure and the way in which, we see our clients, consuming the compute that we’re able to provide. So when we build our infrastructure, we really build our infrastructure to be fungible, to be able to be moved back and forth, seamlessly between, training, and, inference. Right? Like, our our our intention is to build AI infrastructure, not training infrastructure, not inference infrastructure. It’s really infrastructure that allows our clients to be able to support the workloads that they need to be able to drive to be successful. We have seen a massive increase in our workloads that are being used for inference, and we’re able to to monitor that by the profile that the power is being consumed within the data centers. So when you have big training runs that come on and off, that’s a step function of power consumption, either up or down, as opposed to when you are using your compute for inference, which is much more incremental in its nature. In in addition to that, the the the infrastructure that we’re building has been increasingly been used for chain of reasoning, which is driving a substantial amount of consumption on the inference level. And that’s very exciting for us. As as I always say, you know, inference is the monetization of artificial intelligence, and we are extremely excited to see that use case expanding within our infrastructure. On the the the second question in terms of the the the supply side, you know, at at the end of the day, right now, it’s the powered shells that are the choke point, that is causing the struggle to get enough infrastructure online for the demand signals that we are seeing, not just within our company. It’s the massive demand signals that you’re seeing across the industry. And at the end of the day, what we are looking at, and I think what you’re hearing across the board, is that this is a structurally supply constrained market. It is a market that is really working hard to try and balance, and it is it it there are fundamental components at the powered shell, at the power in terms of the electrons moving through the grid, at the supply chains that exist within the GPUs, the supply chains that exist within the, you know, mid voltage transformers. There’s a lot of different pieces that are constrained. But, ultimately, the piece that is the most significant challenge right now is accessing powered shells that are capable of delivering the scale of infrastructure that our clients are requiring.</p>

<p><a id="post-15"></a>
[15] <strong>Keith Weiss, Analyst, Morgan Stanley</strong> Keith Weiss, Analyst, Morgan Stanley: That’s super helpful. Thank you so much.</p>

<p><a id="post-16"></a>
[16] <strong>Tina, Conference Operator</strong> Tina, Conference Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-17"></a>
[17] <strong>Mark Murphy, Analyst, JPMorgan</strong> Mark Murphy, Analyst, JPMorgan: Thank you so much. Congratulations on a robust RPO backlog figures and declining cost of capital. It’s a great combination. Mike, we’ve heard commentary that many governments actually around the world want to build their own version of Stargate and that they’ve begun to reach out. Can you comment on any developments, with respect to some of the sovereign governments, that want to build, modern AI data centers? And what do you think might determine whether whether they’re comfortable using a US based, provider such as CoreWeave? Then I</p>

<p><a id="post-18"></a>
[18] <strong>Michael Turrin, Analyst, Wells Fargo</strong> Michael Turrin, Analyst, Wells Fargo: have a quick follow-up.</p>

<p><a id="post-19"></a>
[19] <strong>Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave</strong> Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave: Yeah. So so it’s a very broad question, and you’re gonna have different jurisdictions, diff different sovereigns that are going to react differently to that question. What we have seen is that many of the sovereigns are really looking for best in class technical solutions to allow them to build the infrastructure that will allow their aspirations within artificial intelligence to be as successful as possible. We have a tremendous number of sovereigns that are beginning and discussing and talking through how to go about doing this, what technology to use, what software stack to use, where it should be placed, you know, right up and down the line. And we we are very confident that we will continue to expand our footprint within the sovereign cloud universe. There are other jurisdictions that are going to be less welcoming to to tech coming out of The US, and that’s just the nature of the way the world is gonna unfold for this. We’ve had some success in Canada. We’re really excited about our partnership with Cohere up there. We think they they they’re doing a wonderful job and that that infrastructure is is really well positioned to be successful. We’ve done a a really good job expanding infrastructure across Europe. We feel like we’ll be able to reach clients across the European theater, and we look for our clients to lead us into new jurisdictions where they are will become the anchor tenants that will allow us to expand the build that we do and the software delivery systems that we create in order for let them in order to let them become as successful as they would like to be within the AI infrastructure component of the market.</p>

<p><a id="post-20"></a>
[20] <strong>Mark Murphy, Analyst, JPMorgan</strong> Mark Murphy, Analyst, JPMorgan: Okay. Okay. Understood. And as a follow-up, I believe that you said CoreWeave signed expansion contracts with both hyperscaler customers in the past eight weeks. And just since it’s August 12, could you clarify did you mean that those expansions are already reflected in the Q2 backlog figures? In other words, you’re saying that you did incremental business in the month of June or did you mean that those expansions were signed in July and August?</p>

<p><a id="post-21"></a>
[21] <strong>Nitin Agarwal, CFO, CoreWeave</strong> Nitin Agarwal, CFO, CoreWeave: Thanks Mark for your question. One of those contracts was signed in Q2 and is reflected in the Q2 revenue backlog number. The other one was signed in Q3 and will be reflected in our Q3 revenue backlog number.</p>

<p><a id="post-22"></a>
[22] <strong>Mark Murphy, Analyst, JPMorgan</strong> Mark Murphy, Analyst, JPMorgan: Is there any sense of scale on those, Nitin, or whether it’s core GPU services versus an extension into weights and biases? Or are are you unable to give that kind of detail yet?</p>

<p><a id="post-23"></a>
[23] <strong>Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave</strong> Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave: Thanks, Deborah, and good afternoon, everyone. CoreWeave had a standout second quarter as we continue our hyper growth journey against the backdrop of unprecedented demand for our AI cloud services. Adoption is expanding rapidly with the enterprise increasingly viewing AI as a strategic imperative and CoreWeave as the force multiplier that enables adoption, innovation and growth for training as well as inference workloads. As a result, revenue grew a better than expected 207% year over year to $200,000,000 for the second quarter with adjusted operating income of $200,000,000 This marks the first quarter in which we reached both $1,000,000,000 in revenue and $200,000,000 of adjusted operating income. Scaling our capacity and services remains a key ingredient for our success in this structurally undersupplied market. To that end, we ended the quarter with nearly four seventy megawatts of active power, and we increased total contracted power approximately 600 megawatts to 2.2 gigawatts. We are aggressively expanding our footprint on the back of intensifying demand signals from our customers, ensuring that we maintain a durable, multiyear runway for growth. We are now on track to deliver over 900 megawatts of active power before the end of the year. We ended the second quarter with $30,100,000,000 in contracted backlog, up $4,000,000,000 from Q1 and doubling year to date. This includes not only the $4,000,000,000 expansion with OpenAI we previously discussed, but new customer wins ranging from large enterprise to AI startup. Importantly, we’ve also signed expansion contracts with both of our hyperscale customers in the past eight weeks. Our pipeline remains robust, growing and increasingly diverse, driven by a full range of customers from media and entertainment to health care to finance to industrials and everything in between. The proliferation of AI capabilities into new use cases and industries is driving increased demand for our specialized cloud infrastructure and services. For instance, while it’s early stages, in the 2025, we saw more than a four x increase in our VFX cloud service product conductor and entered a multiyear contract for NVIDIA’s g b 200 NVL 72 system with Moon Valley, an AI video generation startup that lets filmmakers craft professional grade clips with granular cinematic control. We are seeing an increased adoption in the financial services sector as we expand our relationship in proprietary trading like Jane Street and are adding mega cap bank clients like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. We are also seeing significant growth from health care and life science verticals and are proud of our partnership with customers like Hippocratic AI, who built safe and secure AI agents to enable better health care outcomes. In short, AI applications are beginning to permeate all areas of the economy, both through start ups and enterprise, and demand for our cloud AI services is aggressively growing. Our cloud portfolio is critical to CoreWeave’s ability to meet this growing demand. Our focus on delivering the industry’s most performant purpose built AI cloud infrastructure makes us the platform of choice for both training and inference across incumbent AI labs and new entrants alike. We’re helping these customers redefine how data is consumed and utilized globally as their critical innovation partner, and we are being rewarded for our efforts as they shift additional spend to our platform. We continued to execute and invest aggressively in our platform up and down the stack to deliver the bleeding edge AI cloud services, performance and reliability that our customers require to power their AI innovations. For example, during the second quarter, we delivered NVIDIA’s g b 200, NVL 72, and HGX b 200 at scale deployments, fully integrated into CoreWeave’s mission control for reliability and performance management. Mission control continues to be the cornerstone of CoreWeave’s ability to scale at breakneck speed, building a fully automated and rigorous process for cluster life cycle management with unmatched visibility for our customers. In addition to chaos, we began our private preview of an innovative archive tier object storage product with automatic tiering and industry leading economics and with a simplified cost structure that makes optimizing storage costs for start ups and enterprises seamless. As a result, customers are shifting petabytes of their core storage to CoreWeave in the form of multiyear contracts. We are providing support for additional third party storage systems tightly integrated into CoreWeave’s technology stack with large scale production deployments of VAST, Weka, IBM Spectrum Scale, DDN, and Pure Storage. With Weights and Bias, we deliver an integrated full stack observability feature, giving researchers immediate feedback to diagnose the factors impacting performance and reliability of their AI workloads from the data center through network fabrics and storage, GPUs, and up to their machine learning code. We launched the Coraweave and Weights and Biased inference service utilizing our incredibly reliable compute platform to power research friendly API for state of the art AI models, including OpenAI’s new open source model, Meta’s Llama four, DeepSeq, KIMI k two, and QN three. This new product allows customers to easily bring AI inference into production on their applications with tight integration into our Weave product, ensuring visibility into the service, quality and safety. We continued our investment in Sunk, Slurm on Kubernetes, which is used by many of the largest AI labs and enterprises in the world, providing improved identity federation, research segmentation and scale. We began introducing flexible capacity products to help our customers better manage their end customer demand. In addition to our on demand and reserved inference offering, our spot product is in customer preview and will be introduced additional capacity product over the second half of the year. We also saw significant growth in our backbone and networking service as one of our largest AI lab customers leveraged our networking backbone to connect its multi cloud inference infrastructure. Our product development road map is robust, and we are excited to announce new cloud services and capabilities over the remainder of the year that will further accelerate growth within the AI ecosystem and empower customers to meet their evolving business needs.</p>

<p><a id="post-28"></a>
[28] <strong>Deborah Crawford, Vice President of Investor Relations, CoreWeave0</strong> Deborah Crawford, Vice President of Investor Relations, CoreWeave0: Obviously, we have like this big debate out how about this imbalance of demand and supply and you talked about a little bit like you know, you from listening to you, it sounds more structural, I. E, that kind of is kind of out longer. Can you talk a little bit about that? Because, you know, we obviously have like Microsoft who is like, yeah, maybe we are in balance soon, but then they pushed it out by another six months. Listening to you sounds a little bit longer. What’s the kind of what are the data points for you on that one? And then the the other follow-up I had was, as you do more inference, how important is latency and hence location of data centers? That’s a number of data that’s coming up a lot with us. Thank you. Congrats.</p>

<p><a id="post-29"></a>
[29] <strong>Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave</strong> Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave: Sure. So so we have been unwavering in our assessment of the structural supply constraint that exist in this market. I I think that there are other entities that have repositioned, restated, and rethought how they are going to deliver infrastructure and when they are going to deliver infrastructure. But we have never wavered from our belief that the market is structurally supply constrained, and that is based on our discussions and relationships with the largest, most important consumers of this infrastructure in the world. And so, you know, I I I can’t speak to how other organizations are thinking about it. I can only speak to it from what our position is based on our relationships with the buyers that come in looking for the specific solution that we provide, and that is that this market has significant structural supply constraints. As far as the latency goes, I would encourage you to think about latency through a lens of use case. Right? And so when you are in a chain of reasoning query, latency is not particularly important. The the compute is going to be more impactful than the latency or the latency and the relative distance to the the the query. If you’re in a different type of workload, latency becomes more important. Our approach has been, since the early days, to try and place our infrastructure as close to the population centers as we can in order to have the optionality associated with a low latency solution. Having said that, as we move through this cycle of developing artificial intelligence, as we see new models coming out, as we see chain of reasoning, gain more traction, there’s definitely going to be significant demand for latency insensitive workloads that will be able to live in more remote regions.</p>

And then I have a follow-up as well. Thanks.</p>

<p><a id="post-34"></a>
[34] <strong>Nitin Agarwal, CFO, CoreWeave</strong> Nitin Agarwal, CFO, CoreWeave: We have entered new parts of the capital markets and access new pools of capital, driving our cost of capital lower. We priced both of our inaugural and second high yield bond offerings in the past three months. These transactions were upsized due to strong demand and were priced at lower interest rates. More recently, we closed on a landmark secured GPU financing with many of the world’s leading banks, a novel financing structure that CoreWeave has pioneered. As evidenced by these transactions, our access to the capital markets not only remains robust but is deepening. We are grateful for this support in our mission and expect to continue to access less expensive capital sources as we continue to execute. We will continue to verticalize our platform and enhance our control, efficiency and differentiation fueled by our investment both up the stack, as you saw with our acquisition of Weights and Biases last quarter, and down the stack, as highlighted by our proposed acquisition of Core Scientific last month. Our ability to scale state of the art infrastructure will further be bolstered by the more than $6,000,000,000 data center investment we’ve announced in Lancaster, Pennsylvania as well as a large data center project in Kenilworth, New Jersey that we are codeveloping via a joint venture with BlueOwl. These new sites are perfect examples of our broader data center strategy, which allow us to provide a mix of both large scale training and low latency inference compute across the country.</p>

<p><a id="post-35"></a>
[35] <strong>Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave</strong> Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave: Yeah. So look. For for for our business model, the the the inference consumption and the training consumption, the economics are identical. The the overwhelming majority, and we spoke about this in our last, earnings call, the overwhelming majority of our infrastructure has been sold in long term structured contracts in order to be able to deliver compute to our clients that need to consume it for training and for inference over time. And so we don’t see a real fluctuation in the economics associated with with inference or training. Having said that, I think that it stands to reason to think that when a new model is released and there’s a rush to explore the new model, to use the new model, to to kind of drive new queries into it, you will see a spike in demand within a given AI lab that may cause there to be a spike in the short term pricing associated with inference. And we see those, but but as we’ve said before, the the the on demand component of compute is a very small percentage of our overall workloads. And we are observing inference cases on older generations of the hardwares, the a one hundreds, the h one hundreds. They’re still being recontracted out. They’re being bought on term in order to serve the inference loads that people continue to have, continue to see and need compute to be able to serve.</p>

[36] <strong>Deborah Crawford, Vice President of Investor Relations, CoreWeave1</strong> Deborah Crawford, Vice President of Investor Relations, CoreWeave1: Thanks. And that’s actually relates to my follow-up question because in your prepared remarks, you talked about flexible capacity products coming online in the back half and a spot product and customer preview. Can you just expand about on what that looks like maybe different than what you’re already offering? What GPU generations will be available? And how we might think about pricing versus reserved the take or pay style contracts that you you more typically do?</p>

<p><a id="post-37"></a>
[37] <strong>Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave</strong> Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave: Yeah. So look. We’re gonna continue to build up our on demand and spot pricing offer. Right? It’s gonna take time. The biggest challenge that we have is that every time we’re able to build capacity, it is immediately consumed by one of our existing or a new client that wants to expand their exposure to additional compute to be able to serve their models. And so that that has been a continual challenge for us. I guess it’s a good problem to have, but it’s a problem for us. But that product, we’re we’re working diligently to be able to expand that capacity so that we’re able to to provide more of a a spot product. A big part of that, just so you understand, is so that we can identify new users of compute, identify new companies that are coming into existence, identify new use cases that need compute so that we can build services that are appropriate for them, that allow them to build their businesses and and sell their product into the market. And so we really want to be able to do that. And we wanna be able to to to have that offering, but it it is challenging in a market that is so demand constrained.</p>

[42] <strong>Michael Turrin, Analyst, Wells Fargo</strong> Michael Turrin, Analyst, Wells Fargo: all getting CoreWeave. Just if you could help us calibrate a bit more on what to expect from that metric going forward. How often is it the case that you can find a customer scale to move the needle sequentially there? And where does that $30,000,000,000 sit relative to the opportunities you still see in front of you? Thanks very much.</p>

<p><a id="post-43"></a>
[43] <strong>Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave</strong> Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave: Thank you. So, first of all, it’s important to understand that the demand for compute that we’re seeing is from from our largest, most important clients is expanding in scale, in magnitude, in in in you know, this is a planetary rebuild of the infrastructure that they require in order to be able to deliver their products to the market. And so when when we’re looking at, our pipeline and we are looking at the contracts that are in that pipeline that we are working on, They are extremely significant. They will move the needle. Having said that, these contracts are heavily negotiated, and they do take a significant amount of time in order to move through the cycle to make sure that everything is done correctly so that we can successfully deliver the product and quality that our clients require. And so we think that you’re going to continue to see step functions in compute as these large clients take large blocks of compute over long periods of time from CoreWheel. They like our product. They like the way we deliver compute. They like the performance of the compute, and they will continue to buy from us as long as we can continue to build and deliver this infrastructure.</p>

[45] <strong>Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave</strong> Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave: Now I’d like to come back to our proposed acquisition of Core Scientific. We believe the combination will accelerate value creation for shareholders of both companies. Both the Core Weave and Core Scientific management teams and boards have evaluated this transaction extensively and concluded this is the best for both companies and their shareholders. The rationale behind the deal is quite simple and powerful. Verticalization creates tremendous operational and financial efficiencies that will strengthen our ability to serve our customers at scale. Owning the infrastructure will allow CoreWeave to scale faster and more efficiently. The integration of Core Scientific meaningfully advances our capacity to operate one of the largest and most sophisticated AI cloud platforms in the world. Upon closing, CoreWave would own approximately 1.3 gigawatts of gross power capacity across Core Scientific’s national data center footprint, with an incremental one gigawatt or more available for future expansion. This scale enhances our flexibility to take on new projects and meet accelerated customer demand. In addition, the acquisition would drive the immediate elimination of more than $10,000,000,000 in future lease liability overhead as well as a more streamlined and efficient operating model. As a result, we anticipate $500,000,000 in fully ramped annual run rate cost savings by the 2027, benefiting both the Core Scientific and CoreWeave shareholders directly. Vertical integration will allow us to finance infrastructure more efficiently, furthering one of our key objectives in lowering our cost of capital and enabling us to grow in a more capital efficient manner. We and Core Scientific look forward to discussing the transaction with you in the months ahead. Our respective teams are already engaged in pre integration planning to ensure we’re ready to hit the ground running. To that end, we are executing with pace and purpose amidst the market in which the supply demand imbalance is only deepening as new enterprise adopters increasingly compete with large AI labs for limited capacity and services. We’re building on our leadership across all key success criteria from power access to AI cloud service performance to revenue and backlog growth. And we will keep getting stronger as we verticalize our data center infrastructure and cloud services. I am excited about the momentum that we are building upon. I want to thank our customers, teams and business and financial partners for making it possible. Now here’s Nitin.</p>

<p><a id="post-47"></a>
[47] <strong>Unattributed</strong> : Great. And I’ll add my congratulations. In the Q2, can you give us a sense of how successfully you were able to repurpose older GPU clusters that had come off contract? Any changes today vis a vis how this was trending around the start of the year?</p>

<p><a id="post-48"></a>
[48] <strong>Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave</strong> Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave: Yeah. So thank you for the question. It’s a great question. So what we are seeing is we are seeing the infrastructure that is being delivered off of these contracts being recontracted out for additional term in order to be able to continue to deliver that compute largely for inference. And so we’re talking about the the h one hundreds. We’re talking about the a one hundreds. We’re talking about delivery of this compute into contracts that are anywhere between one and three years in extension after the initial contract is over. And so we’re pretty excited about that. We’ve also seen things, and this this came up in the last call where, you know, the the the the the OpenAI contract was contracted out for five years with two additional one year extensions, which also provides a significant amount of transparency into how people view the run out of compute as it becomes an older generation.</p>

[50] <strong>Tina, Conference Operator</strong> Tina, Conference Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-51"></a>
[51] <strong>Keith Weiss, Analyst, Morgan Stanley</strong> Keith Weiss, Analyst, Morgan Stanley: Yes. Thank you for taking the question. Two for me. So one question just on timing. You talked about the big CapEx ramp in Q4. Obviously, the revenue guide also implies a pretty big step up in Q4. Can you just help us understand the timing aspect there, particularly with CapEx a little bit lighter than we expected in Q2? Is this simply kind of delays related to Blackwell? Or is it specific to kind of contracts that you’re expecting to ramp in Q4? And then the second question just on the cost side, you did highlight some increased costs. Obviously, you took up the revenue guide but left operating income unchanged for the full year. So could you just elaborate like what are those specific costs that you have to incur ahead of these contracts? Like what is kind of coming in a bit higher than you expected? Just that would help us out in in thinking through the mechanics. Thank you.</p>

<p><a id="post-52"></a>
[52] <strong>Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave</strong> Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave: Yeah. So I’ll I’ll I’ll take the first one, and then Nitin can can follow-up on the cost side. So when when we’re looking at our build out in ramp, it goes through a a series of, necessary steps. Right? And so the way that this is going to work is we are going to build from where we are right now an additional 400 plus megawatts of power into our, online and delivered compute and and power. That is followed by the CapEx spend when the power is available, which is then followed by the revenue. And so we are very comfortable with the ramp that we are seeing in front of us in order to deliver the 900 megawatts plus power as we go through q four. It is going to be backloaded, as Nitin said. We knew that it was going to be backloaded as we came in, and and we’re watching the build out and and and scaling of that infrastructure very systematically as we continue to move through the year.</p>

<p><a id="post-53"></a>
[53] <strong>Nitin Agarwal, CFO, CoreWeave</strong> Nitin Agarwal, CFO, CoreWeave: Thanks, Mike. And the other piece I would add to that is that we’ve been operationally preparing for this ramp up in executing and delivering this power by the end of the year. So we are ready to kind of go through that exercise at this moment. When we think about the cost in particular, we do incur costs, especially associated with data center leases and expenses coming online as we deploy this infrastructure and get it ready for our customers before we start generating revenue on that infrastructure. That does create a timing mismatch, especially when you’re adding capacity at the unprecedented scale we are adding, which is what you see reflected in our margin profile for the short duration as these customer contracts ramp up and the infrastructure associated with them is delivered to these customers.</p>

<p><a id="post-56"></a>
[56] <strong>Nitin Agarwal, CFO, CoreWeave</strong> Nitin Agarwal, CFO, CoreWeave: Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Our strong second quarter results highlight the unprecedented demand environment we are seeing and our continued execution to rapidly scale our AI cloud platform to meet that customer demand. Our growth continues to be capacity constrained with demand outstripping supply. Since our Q1 call, we have signed expansion contracts with both our hyperscaler customers. We also closed our acquisition of Weights and Biases and announced our proposed Core Scientific acquisition. In addition, we successfully raised $6,400,000,000 in the capital markets through two high yield offerings and a delayed draw term loan, all of which have opened access to new capital pools at an increasingly lower cost of capital. Turning now to Q2 results, Q2 revenue was $1,200,000,000 growing 207% year over year driven by strong customer demand. Revenue backlog was $30,100,000,000 up 86% year over year and doubled year to date. While our revenue backlog is expected to scale rapidly over time, growth rates will fluctuate from quarter to quarter given the nature of our large committed contract business model, timing and size of new contract signings and revenue recognition. Operating expenses in the second quarter were $1,200,000,000 including stock based compensation expense of 145,000,000 We continue to ramp our investments in data center and server infrastructure to meet growing customer demand, which contributed to the increase in our cost of revenue and technology and infrastructure spend in Q2. In addition, the increase in sales and marketing was largely driven by marketing spend to accelerate new customer acquisition and raise awareness of our differentiated capabilities. The increase in G and A was largely driven by professional services. Adjusted operating income for Q2 was $200,000,000 compared to $85,000,000 in Q2 twenty twenty four. Our Q2 twenty five adjusted operating income margin was 16%. Net loss for the quarter was $291,000,000 compared to a $323,000,000 net loss in 2024. Interest expense for Q2 was $267,000,000 compared to $67,000,000 in 2024 due to increased debt to support our infrastructure scaling partly offset by lower cost of capital. Adjusted net loss for Q2 was $131,000,000 compared to a $5,000,000 adjusted net loss in 2024. The adjusted net loss was impacted by increases in interest expense due to scaling of our infrastructure, partly offset by growth in adjusted operating income. Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 was $753,000,000 compared to $250,000,000 in 2024 scaling more than 3x year over year and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 62% roughly in line with Q2 of last year. Turning to capital expenditures, CapEx in Q2 totaled $2,900,000,000 which is up over $1,000,000,000 quarter over quarter as we scale rapidly to meet our accelerating customer demand. We are executing at a massive scale and the demand continues to outpace supply. As a reminder, CapEx consists primarily of investments in property and technology equipment and is calculated as a change in gross PP and E minus the change in construction in progress. Construction in progress represents infrastructure not yet in service, so it is not yet revenue generating. In addition, the timing of data center capacity coming online and generations of GPUs being placed into service could drive significant variation quarter to quarter, an example of which you will see in our Q4 CapEx ramp. Now let’s turn to our balance sheet and strong liquidity position. We have designed our capital structure to enable rapid scaling. As of June 30, we had $2,100,000,000 in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. Other than payments on OEM vendor financing and self amortizing debt through committed contract payments, we have no debt maturities until 2028. As Mike mentioned, we continue to see strong success in the capital markets. Growing at a rapid pace and executing at scale requires a unique and sophisticated approach to securing the funding required. CoreWeave continues to be not only the leading AI technology partner, but also the leading innovator in financing the infrastructure required by the world’s most advanced AI labs and enterprises. Since the beginning of 2024, we have secured over $25,000,000,000 of debt and equity to fund the build out and scale the leading AI cloud platform. In May, we launched and closed our first unsecured high yield offering of $2,000,000,000 which was upsized by $500,000,000 due to strong demand. In July, we reentered the market and raised an additional $1,750,000,000 also oversubscribed at a lower interest rate. More recently, we closed our third delayed draw term loan facility. This $2,600,000,000 facility completes the financing for the 11,900,000,000 OpenAI contract we announced in March. Notably, the transaction was completed at a cost of capital of SOFR plus 400, a 900 basis point decrease from the non investment grade portion of our prior facility DDTL2 and was the first one to be fully underwritten by top tier banks. Together, these financings highlight our ability to drive a sustained reduction in our cost of capital and the increasing depth of access we have to the capital markets, both of which were stated goals during our IPO. Turning to tax, again in Q2, we recorded an income tax provision despite a net loss due to impacts from non deductible items and the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets. Our tax rate might fluctuate significantly in the future due to similar factors. Now turning to guidance for Q3 and for full year 2025. As Mike mentioned, we are seeing an acceleration of customer demand and our pipeline remains robust and increasingly diversified. We are still operating in a structurally supply constrained environment where demand far outstrips supply for our products and services. Our operations and engineering teams are working relentlessly to deploy more capacity faster for our customers. With a strong demand backdrop, we expect Q3 revenue in the range of 1,260,000,000.00 to $1,300,000,000 In addition, we anticipate Q3 adjusted operating income between 160,000,000 to $190,000,000 as we are quickly ramping our capacity to meet customer demand. As we have discussed earlier, as we deploy scaled capacity and bring large chunks of capacity online, we incur some costs prior to revenue generation. The scale of our deployments relative to our base implies that these costs ahead of revenue have a short term impact on our margins. We expect our Q3 interest expense to be in the range of $350,000,000 to $390,000,000 impacted by increased debt to support our demand led CapEx growth partly offset by increasingly lower cost of capital. We expect our CapEx for the third quarter to be $2,900,000,000 and $3,400,000,000 In addition, like last quarter, we expect stock based compensation to remain slightly elevated throughout the year for grants issued in connection with the IPO and incremental hiring to support our growth. Moving to full year guidance, for the second quarter in a row, we are raising our full year revenue guidance. For 2025, we now expect revenue in the range of 5,150,000,000.00 to $5,350,000,000 a $250,000,000 increase from our prior guidance of 4,900,000,000.0 to 5,100,000,000.0 driven by continued strong customer demand. We expect adjusted operating income in the range of 800,000,000 to $830,000,000 unchanged from our prior guidance as we remain cost disciplined while rapidly scaling our deployments at an unprecedented rate to end the year with over 900 megawatts of active power. We expect CapEx in the range of $20,000,000,000 to $23,000,000,000 unchanged from our prior guidance in the backdrop of continued strong customer demand. A significant portion of our full year CapEx will fall in Q4 due to the timing of go live dates of our infrastructure. We had an outstanding first half of the year and our outlook remains strong. We are entering the second half of the year in an excellent position with strong execution in delivering at scale for our customers as well as execution in the capital markets and a robust backlog coupled with a very healthy demand pipeline. As we move into the second half, we will continue investing to meet the needs of our growing customer base while reinforcing our leadership in this transformational market. Thank you to our investors and analysts for your support and engagement. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the quarters to come. With that, we will move to Q and A.</p>

<p><a id="post-57"></a>
[57] <strong>Keith Weiss, Analyst, Morgan Stanley</strong> Keith Weiss, Analyst, Morgan Stanley: Wonderful. Thank you so much and I’ll echo the congratulations on a real solid Q2 here. I wanted to ask about the different segments of the market here. You think about that in the big three, the big enterprise AI companies or hyperscalers, if you will. And then you have the AI labs and then the enterprises themselves. As you’ve been embarking on this more product led, software led sale with weights and biases and the investment in Kubernetes, Splunk for Kubernetes, for example, are you seeing more of the pipeline, more of the business coming in weighted towards that next wave of AI lab and and then eventually enterprises themselves? Any commentary on just the the end segments? Thank you.</p>

<p><a id="post-58"></a>
[58] <strong>Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave</strong> Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave: Yeah. We’re we’re we’re seeing incredibly broad based demand for the compute, and it is coming from the the massive labs. Right? Like, that’s that’s clear. But what is less probably recognized in the market is that you’re getting real green shoots in the sectorial growth of different parts of this marketing. Like, you know, we we try to make a little bit of a reference in in in in the in the the the initial statement. Right? Like, we saw, you know, within our VFX, we saw, you know, companies like Moon Valley. Right? Like, that that that’s incredible. Right? Like, it’s a new area of real growth from a new lab that’s that’s building, you know, products for for a different part of the market, and that’s really exciting. You know, the the financial players are really great to see. That’s that’s an enterprise type of client, but it also represents a different use for the actual computing infrastructure, an uncorrelated revenue source for us that we’re really excited about. You know, the big banks are starting to really show up, and they are massive consumers of compute. And so, you know, the the productization within the enterprise, you know, companies like Hippocratic AI, you know, these are really representative of different parts of the economy starting to adopt AI, using it to deliver services to different parts of the economy, and we think that’s tremendously exciting. Keep in mind that you’ve got a scale prop. Right? And that when you have a a company like OpenAI or an entity like OpenAI consuming compute, they’re just doing it at an order of magnitude that these other companies have not achieved yet. And so we’re we’re excited to see the green shoots. We think it’s fantastic. We love that it is is broadening the consumption of compute, but we are also well aware that for the time being, these really large consumers of compute will dominate the the the client component of of of our pipeline. One of the things that we’re we’re incredibly excited about is how Weights and Biases has, like, impacted our pipeline. Right? Weights and Biases brings in 1,600 new clients. They bring in clients like British Telecom. It’s just it’s fantastic to see us forming relationships with these enterprise clients that are experimenting or learning or integrating AI into what they do, and it gives us an opportunity to position ourselves to become a supplier to them of the software and the hardware that they’re gonna require to be successful.</p>

<p><a id="post-59"></a>
[59] <strong>Keith Weiss, Analyst, Morgan Stanley</strong> Keith Weiss, Analyst, Morgan Stanley: Super exciting. Thank you, Mike. And then one more if I may, please. I know cost of debt is a big focus for you. Congratulations on the last two capital raises bringing that down. As equity investors, we’re not in those conversations with creditors. Would love to get your kind of sense from those conversations. What are the puts and takes that are driving that cost of debt down? Thank you so much.</p>

<p><a id="post-60"></a>
[60] <strong>Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave</strong> Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave: It’s hard to overstate how excited I am about the progress that we have been able to make within the capital markets, within the debt markets. You know, in a very fundamental way, what we have been doing is we have been bringing to bear the largest part of the capital markets, the debt markets, to the problem of building and scaling infrastructure. And it is an absolute necessity that that part of the market, those pools of capital are able to come to bear because of the size, scale, and cost of what needs to be done to build compute at a planetary scale. And so it’s just incredible progress, and I’m incredibly proud of the team here that has been able to, deliver the quality of infrastructure, the the that that lenders can understand, get their arms around, and underwrite. And and it’s been three deals that have really gone through this step function. There were two deals within the high yield space, and then there was the new DDTL, you know, the delayed draw term loan. And that came in at, you know, SOFR plus 400. That entirely changes the economics that are embedded in the contracts that we are delivering to the market. And it is a step function of massive importance when Nitin is able to say, hey. We were able to drop our noninvestment grade borrowing cost by 900 basis points. That’s a seismic level shift in the cost of capital.</p>

<p><a id="post-63"></a>
[63] <strong>Deborah Crawford, Vice President of Investor Relations, CoreWeave</strong> Deborah Crawford, Vice President of Investor Relations, CoreWeave: Sorry. We have time for one last question.</p>

<p><a id="post-64"></a>
[64] <strong>Tina, Conference Operator</strong> Tina, Conference Operator: Thank you. And your final question comes from the line of Mike Sikos with Needham and Company. Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-65"></a>
[65] <strong>Deborah Crawford, Vice President of Investor Relations, CoreWeave2</strong> Deborah Crawford, Vice President of Investor Relations, CoreWeave2: Great. Thanks for taking the questions and squeezing me in here, guys. A bit of a two porter. I just wanted to come back to the weights and biases. Great to hear on the 1,600 clients and how that’s impacting the pipeline. Imagine this goes hand in hand with some of the increased OpEx investment we’re seeing. But can you talk about where we were on the sales front as far as getting in front of those customers? You obviously had the fully connected developer event, but how is that tracking? And then the second piece I wanted to ask you about for on demand and spot availability, again, I think Mike you had said it’s a high quality problem for sure that as soon as it comes off contract, it’s going back on. But do you need on demand and spot availability to increase as another avenue for new logo acquisition to tie to inference with these newer customers or not necessarily? Thank you.</p>

<p><a id="post-66"></a>
[66] <strong>Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave</strong> Mike Entrater, CEO, CoreWeave: Yeah. So so so look. The the integration with Weights and Bias between the two companies has been, fantastic. It’s been one of the things that is so exciting to, the legacy CoreWave employees and the legacy Weight Minds, employees. I think that, you know, putting, two organizations into a room that are, so incredibly focused on the clients leads to incredible outcomes. And there have been three real products that have been developed by the combination of the Weights and Bias and the CoreWeek teams. Right? And so we’ve integrated Weights and Bias into the Mission Control integration, which gives Weights and Bias clients historically the ability to now access the incredible observability in the mission control product to improve the performance of their use of the AI infrastructure. We’ve built a weights and bias inference product, which once again allows them an incredible amount of control over how they’re using compute, what they’re using compute, how it’s impacting, you know, from from really the data center all the way up. And that level of transparency, clarity is just an incredible differentiator for the services that we provide that differentiate our compute from other providers. And that’s, you know, been been a huge step function. And then the final product is actually the Weave product that that has been pushed out by Weights and Biased and CoreWeave, which will allow folks to really make massive strides in optimizing all the way from their GPU through the code in their model to be able to drive performance. And so that’s that’s super exciting for us, and we do think that it will lead to increased traction. We have always been a organization that has leaned on the concept of land and expand. We we we get a client to come in and try our infrastructure. The the incredible performance of our infrastructure leads to a deeper relationship, leads to larger contracts, leads to a broadening of how they use us to drive their business. And that’s that’s a tried and true. You know, when I when I I’ll go back to the the Moon Valley and and the the VFX side of the house. It’s the same concept when we acquired Conductor. It’s how you go about introducing yourself to this new area of the market and build upon it and expand upon it and bring in new clients. And so, you know, it’s it that acquisition is really moving along exactly how we had hoped it would. With regards to your question around on demand and spot, like, I I I tried to to say this earlier. I’ll I’ll I’ll I’ll go about it a different way is that, like, different use cases approach compute in different ways. They need different things. The profile of compute, the tooling that they’re going to require, all of those things are incredibly important. And by having on demand, what you’re doing is you’re creating a portion of our infrastructure that new players can use so that they can build new product. They can open up new markets. And we really wanna be able to continue to expand our footprint there because we think it’s important. We’ve been very successful with it in the early days of our growth, and we think that it’s an important part of what we will need to do to continue to provide such incredible productization of our compute over time.</p>

[82] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: What cost‑synergy targets and timing has CoreWeave disclosed for the Core Scientific acquisition, including any breakdown supporting the cited $500 million savings by 2027? A: Short answer — CoreWeave (announced July 7, 2025) targets “&gt;$500M” of fully‑ramped, annual run‑rate cost savings by the end of 2027, with an immediate (day‑1) elimination of “&gt;$10B” of cumulative future lease overhead. Management says the $500M estimate comprises that lease‑overhead removal (day‑1) plus ongoing “synergized operating expenses” and lower cost of capital from asset ownership, but it has not published a line‑by‑line dollar breakdown or schedule beyond “fully ramped by end of 2027.” Expected close: Q4 2025 (subject to approvals).

A: Short answer: No public, numeric market‑based Scope 2 totals or companywide electricity‑consumption figures for 2024 or H1‑2025 are published by CoreWeave. Their SEC filings say they are “evaluating and measuring Scopes 1 and 2” (no totals or market‑ vs location‑based breakdown published), and public releases note some sites (e.g., UK Crawley/London campuses) are powered by renewable energy but do not provide a consolidated Scope‑2 (market‑based) figure or REC accounting methodology.(<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1769628/000095012325000507/filename1.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com">sec.gov</a>, <a href="https://www.coreweave.com/news/coreweave-announces-two-initial-data-centers-in-the-uk-are-now-operational?utm_source=chatgpt.com">coreweave.com</a>) If you want, I can (a) search deeper for any investor‑day/ESG slides or CDP disclosure, or (b) draft an email you can send CoreWeave IR asking for their Scope‑2 (market‑based) MWh/tonnes, accounting basis, and REC treatment.</p>

[85] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: What professional services revenue and gross margin did CoreWeave report for 2024 and year‑to‑date 2025, and has management provided any disclosed data on average enterprise onboarding durations from proof‑of‑concept to production? A: Short answer — CoreWeave does not separately disclose “professional services” revenue or a professional‑services gross margin in its SEC filings or earnings releases. Instead, only consolidated figures are reported: - 2024 (full year): revenue $1,915,426k; cost of revenue $493,350k → gross margin ≈ 74.3%. (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1769628/000119312525058309/d899798ds1a.htm">sec.gov</a>) - Year‑to‑date 2025 (six months ended June 30, 2025): revenue $2,194,420k; cost of revenue $575,061k → gross margin ≈ 73.8%. (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Reports-Strong-Second-Quarter-2025-Results">investors.coreweave.com</a>) On onboarding durations: management has spoken qualitatively about reducing time-to‑deploy / getting customers “production ready on day one,” but I find no disclosed, numeric average for enterprise proof‑of‑concept → production times in the S‑1, earnings releases or call transcripts.

A: Short answer — CoreWeave has publicly disclosed several self‑reported 2024–2025 metrics but no independent, public breakdown isolating the effects of Mission Control, the W&amp;B integration, or SUNK. What CoreWeave disclosed (public posts/press): - Model FLOPS Utilization (MFU) &gt;50% and “up to 20%” higher MFU vs. public benchmarks (March 19, 2025). (<a href="https://www.coreweave.com/blog/coreweave-leads-the-charge-in-ai-infrastructure-efficiency-with-up-to-20-higher-gpu-cluster-performance-than-alternative-solutions">coreweave.com</a>) - “Goodput” up to 96%, interruptions/day and MTTF ranges from internal tests (example: 4,096‑GPU run → 96% goodput, 0.96 interruptions/day). (<a href="https://www.coreweave.com/blog/achieve-ai-infrastructure-goodput-of-up-to-96-with-3-key-strategies?utm_source=chatgpt.com">coreweave.com</a>) - MLPerf v5.0 results (GB200/Blackwell): &gt;2× faster training vs. comparable Hopper submissions; CoreWeave says these runs used SUNK/CKS/Mission Control.

[87] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: What are the detailed terms of CoreWeave’s $2.6 billion delayed‑draw secured facility that closed on July 31, 2025—including SOFR margin, original issue discount, tenor, amortization schedule, and collateral package—and how do these terms compare with CoreWeave’s prior debt facilities closed in 2024–2025? A: Short answer — verified from CoreWeave’s SEC filings and press release: • Key DDTL 3.0 economics and mechanics: SOFR +4.00% (or base-rate option at +3.00%), undrawn fee 0.50% p.a., draws available until July 2026, maturity August 21, 2030. Repayments begin on the first monthly payment date on or after April 1, 2026; any remaining principal due at maturity; prepayment before the 30‑month anniversary of the commitment termination requires a make‑whole equal to the PV of interest through that date. Collateral: secured by “substantially all” assets of CoreWeave Compute Acquisition Co. VII, LLC and unconditionally guaranteed by CoreWeave. OID (original‑issue‑discount) and detailed amortization percentages/schedule beyond the monthly start and final maturity are not disclosed in the public 8‑K/10‑Q press release.

[89] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of August 12, 2025, which CoreWeave data center sites slated for second-half 2025 activation have received utility energization letters and interconnection approvals, and what aggregate megawatts do those approvals cover versus remaining pending capacity? A: Short answer — I found no publicly posted utility “energization letters” or formal interconnection‑approval notices for CoreWeave sites scheduled to come online in H2 2025. Public filings show the primary H2‑2025 sites were Applied Digital’s Ellendale (100 MW expected Q4‑2025) and Core Scientific‑owned capacity (CoreWeave had been targeting ~270 MW by H2‑2025). Because no energization/interconnection confirmations appear in public press releases/SEC/IR material as of Aug 12, 2025, there are 0 MW publicly confirmed as energized/approved and the 100–≈270 MW remain pending (timing varies by site).

[91] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Do CoreWeave’s publicly available customer contracts or service descriptions specify preemption or isolation service‑level objectives for enterprise inference workloads, and are there any published historical adherence statistics or third‑party audit reports? A: Short answer: Public CoreWeave docs/TOS specify general uptime SLOs (99.9% multi‑region, 99% single‑region) but do not publish dedicated “preemption” or formal isolation SLOs for enterprise inference. Their pricing FAQ says they do not offer spot/preemptible instances; CoreWeave’s CKS product documents eviction labels and dedicated‑cluster/VPC isolation features (behavior documented, not formal SLOs). CoreWeave states it holds/works to SOC2/ISO standards and (per its DPA) will provide certifications/audit summaries to customers on request, but I found no publicly posted SOC2/attestation reports or historical SLO‑adherence dashboards.

[104] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: What are the publicly disclosed base term, extension options, and any minimum capacity or spend commitments in the 2025 GPU supply agreement between CoreWeave and OpenAI? A: Short answer — public disclosures say the OpenAI–CoreWeave Master Services Agreement (signed March 2025) commits OpenAI to pay CoreWeave up to ≈$11.9 billion through October 2030 (i.e., the agreement runs to Oct 2030). The filings state the MSA supplies reserved-capacity orders, may be amended by mutual agreement, and can be terminated for cause, but they do not publicly describe formal extension options or a line-item minimum GPU‑capacity (MW/GPU count) or a periodic minimum spend beyond the “up to ~$11.9B” commitment (payments are “subject to delivery and availability” requirements). The deal also includes a $350M equity issuance to OpenAI.

[105] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: What breakdown has CoreWeave provided of its 2025 capital expenditure guidance of $20–$23 billion among compute hardware, data center construction and power infrastructure, networking, and other categories, and what portion is expected to be financed through vendor or lease financing? A: Short answer: CoreWeave has not published a line‑item split of its 2025 $20–$23B capex into “compute hardware,” “data‑center construction &amp; power,” “networking,” and “other.” Management describes the spend as “success‑based” and primarily for GPUs/compute and data‑center capacity, and says it will finance growth with asset‑backed delayed‑draw term‑loans (DDTLs), OEM/vendor financings and other debt — but it has not given a percent/amount of the 2025 guidance that will be vendor/lease financed. See company filings and the Q1 results/press release for details (DDTL 2.0 facility terms and ~$1.3B of OEM financing noted as of year‑end 2024).

[106] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: In 2024–2025, what conversion rates from on-demand or spot usage to reserved GPU contracts and average time-to-conversion has CoreWeave publicly reported, if any? A: Short answer: CoreWeave has not publicly disclosed a numeric “conversion rate” (e.g., % of on‑demand/spot users who convert to reserved/committed GPU contracts) nor an average time‑to‑conversion in 2024–2025. Public filings instead report the mix of revenue (committed contracts: 96% of 2024 revenue; &gt;98% of revenue in early‑2025 quarters) and anecdotal expansion timing (e.g., three of its top five committed‑contract customers expanded within 12 months).

[107] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: What power usage effectiveness (PUE) and water usage effectiveness (WUE) metrics has CoreWeave published for its operating data centers in 2024–2025, and how do these compare with prior disclosed benchmarks? A: Short answer (as of Aug 14, 2025): - CoreWeave’s public 2024–2025 disclosures are facility-level via partners, not a consolidated company PUE/WUE. For example: the MERLIN Edged Barcelona site hosting CoreWeave is reported/designed for PUE ≈ 1.15 and “zero” water cooling (WUE ≈ 0). The Applied Digital (Polaris Forge / Ellendale) campuses CoreWeave leases list a projected PUE ≈ 1.18 and “near‑zero” WUE. (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/The-Mayor-of-Barcelona-Jaume-Collboni-Inaugurates-Data-Center-Hosting-CoreWeaves-Leading-AI-Cloud-Platform-in-Partnership-with-MERLIN-Edged/default.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com">investors.coreweave.com</a>, <a href="https://ir.applieddigital.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/124/2-7-billion-in-data-center-savings-new-applied-digital?utm_source=chatgpt.com">ir.applieddigital.com</a>) - Compared with prior benchmarks: those PUEs are materially better than recent industry averages (Uptime Institute ~1.55–1.58). CoreWeave’s own earlier public materials emphasize liquid cooling and higher power efficiency but do not appear to publish a historical, company‑wide PUE/WUE figure to compare.

A: Short answer — partly public, partly not. CoreWeave said the acquisition gives it ~1.3 GW gross power across Core Scientific’s footprint, with ~840 MW allocated to CoreWeave’s HPC contracts. Core Scientific’s investor materials list per‑site operational/energized MW (examples): Denton ~125 MW (City of Denton/ ERCOT), Pecos/Cottonwood COT1 = 50 MW energized (+21 MW container field; site allocation 250 MW; TNMP/ENGIE/ ERCOT), Calvert City 150 MW (TVA), Grand Forks 100 MW (Minnkota/NoDak), Dalton sites ~195 MW combined (Dalton Utilities/TVA), Marble NC 104 MW.

[109] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: What revenue mix between training and inference has CoreWeave disclosed for Q2 2025 and for full-year 2025 guidance, including the definitions used for each category? A: Short answer: CoreWeave did not disclose a numeric percentage split of revenue between “training” and “inference” for Q2 2025 or in its full‑year 2025 revenue guidance. Its Q2 press release and 10‑Q report give revenue and guidance ($1.212B Q2 revenue; FY‑2025 guidance raised to $5.15–$5.35B) but no % breakdown. Management commented on the earnings call that inference workloads increased in Q2 and explained the categories qualitatively: “training” = large, on/off model‑training runs (step‑function power consumption); “inference” = steady, incremental serving/queries of models. Management also said the economics are broadly similar between them.

A: Short answer: Unknown — CoreWeave has not disclosed those exact figures publicly. Why: In its Q2 2025 results and earnings call CoreWeave said returned A100/H100 clusters are being recontracted into 1–3 year inference agreements, but management gave this qualitatively (no percent of installed A100/H100 capacity recontracted, and no weighted‑average remaining term was published).

[115] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of June 30, 2025, what fleet composition has CoreWeave publicly disclosed by GPU system type (e.g., A100 SXM/NVLink, H100 NVL72, B200 NVL72), including the proportion of capacity deployed in 72-GPU NVLink islands? A: Short answer — CoreWeave has publicly disclosed the GPU system families it operates but has NOT published a granular numeric breakdown by system type or an explicit percentage of capacity sitting in 72‑GPU NVLink (NVL72) “islands” as of June 30, 2025. What CoreWeave has publicly disclosed: - Total fleet scale: &gt;250,000 NVIDIA GPUs (S‑1; majority “Hopper” family as of Dec 31, 2024). (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1769628/000119312525058309/d899798ds1a.htm">sec.gov</a>) - Product / system types publicly offered and deployed by mid‑2025: A100 (SXM/PCIe), H100/H200 (HGX/HGX‑style), NVIDIA Blackwell GB200 NVL72 (GA and “online at scale” by Q2 2025), HGX B200, and (announced July 3, 2025) GB300 NVL72.

[116] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of August 14, 2025, has the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection designated the area of CoreWeave’s Kenilworth, New Jersey data center as an “overburdened community” under N.J.S.A. 13:1D-157 et seq., and what air permit class (minor vs. major source) and public participation requirements apply to the site’s planned backup generation? A: Short answer: I could not find any authoritative NJDEP record (map/list entry or press release) explicitly showing that the census block group containing CoreWeave’s Kenilworth site (2000 Galloping Hill Rd / 11 NEST Dr) is designated an “overburdened community” as of Aug 14, 2025. To confirm definitively, enter the site address or coordinates into NJDEP’s EJMAP or check the department’s downloadable OBC list (NJDEP publishes block‑group GEOIDs). (<a href="https://njdepwptest.net/ej/communities/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">njdepwptest.net</a>, <a href="https://mapsdep.nj.gov/arcgis/rest/services/Features/Government/MapServer/42?utm_source=chatgpt.com">mapsdep.nj.gov</a>) Air‑permit / public‑participation summary: whether the planned backup generators trigger “major” vs “minor” status depends on the facility‑wide potential‑to‑emit (PTE). New Jersey uses the federal major‑source thresholds (generally 100 tpy for a criteria pollutant; 10/25 tpy for single/aggregate HAPs); sources at/above those thresholds require a Title V/major source permit and EJ rules (EJIS + 60‑day public notice/hearing, transcript submission, etc.). If PTE is below thresholds, the generators would be minor (general or case‑by‑case minor permit) with the standard DEP notice requirements. (<a href="https://www.epa.gov/title-v-operating-permits/who-has-obtain-title-v-permit?utm_source=chatgpt.com">epa.gov</a>, <a href="https://www9.state.nj.us/dep/DEP_eNJEMS/AGPGeneralProcedures.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">www9.state.nj.us</a>) If you want, I can (1) check the exact block‑group GEOID for 2000 Galloping Hill Rd and query NJDEP’s OBC layer, and (2) estimate PTE for the planned generators (need engine kW/fuel hours) to say whether the site is likely major or minor.</p>

[127] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of August 14, 2025, what has CoreWeave publicly disclosed regarding compliance with the EU NIS2 directive and readiness for the EU Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), including policies for supervisory audits and 24‑hour incident reporting obligations for critical ICT third parties? A: Short answer: I found no public CoreWeave page or press release explicitly stating “NIS2‑compliant” or “DORA‑ready” as of Aug 14, 2025. However, CoreWeave’s published Data Processing Agreement and security pages commit to cooperating with competent supervisory authorities, to permit/participate in audits and to notify customers “without undue delay” of security incidents — but they do not publicly pledge a specific 24‑hour incident notification to EU authorities for critical ICT third‑parties. CoreWeave has also posted hires and job descriptions (GRC/CISO) showing active preparation for EU regulatory requirements. If you need contractual assurance of NIS2/DORA obligations (audits, 24‑hour reporting), request written contract language or an auditor/scope from CoreWeave.

[128] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: In CoreWeave’s Q2 2025 filings (press release and Form 10‑Q), what customer concentration did the company disclose for revenue, accounts receivable, and revenue backlog—by top 1, top 3, and top 5 customers—and were any customers representing over 10% identified by name (e.g., OpenAI or hyperscalers)? A: Short answer - Revenue (Q2 2025): Top‑1 = Customer A = 71% of revenue (three months ended June 30, 2025). No other customer was reported as ≥10% for Q2; the 10‑Q does not provide a full top‑3 or top‑5 revenue breakdown. (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001769628/000176962825000041/crwv-20250630.htm">sec.gov</a>) - Accounts receivable (as of June 30, 2025): Top‑1 = Customer A = 39%; Top‑3 = Customer A + C + D = 39% + 25% + 25% = 89%. No top‑5 AR breakdown was provided. (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001769628/000176962825000041/crwv-20250630.htm">sec.gov</a>) - Revenue backlog: Total backlog $30.1 billion; the filings do not give top‑1/top‑3/top‑5 backlog percentages. The press release and 10‑Q disclose a commercial agreement with OpenAI (up to $11.9B plus a $4B expansion noted in the press release) but CoreWeave’s 10‑Q still anonymizes the &gt;10% revenue/accounts‑receivable customers (Customer A, C, D). In short: OpenAI is named as a major contract contributor to backlog, but the &gt;10% customers in the 10‑Q are not identified by name.

[129] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of June 30, 2025, how does CoreWeave define and calculate its reported $30.1 billion revenue backlog in filings and investor materials—specifically, what portion reflects non‑cancellable contracted minimums versus conditional or “up to” volumes subject to delivery/availability—and what backlog or contract realization rate has management disclosed historically? A: Short answer — based on CoreWeave’s public filings: - Definition: “Revenue backlog” is presented as remaining performance obligations (RPO) and (separately in prior disclosures) additional amounts “subject to the satisfaction of delivery and availability of service requirements” (i.e., conditional/up‑to volumes). RPO is the transaction price for contracted (generally non‑cancellable) revenue that has not yet been recognized and is reported net of estimated variable consideration. (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Reports-Strong-First-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com">investors.coreweave.com</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1769628/000095012325000509/filename1.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com">sec.gov</a>) - As of June 30, 2025: CoreWeave’s Form 10‑Q reports $30.1 billion of unsatisfied RPO and discloses expected timing (≈50% recognized in the first 24 months, ~40% in months 25–48, remainder thereafter). The company’s Q1 (Mar 31, 2025) disclosure showed a split: RPO $14.7B + conditional/subject‑to‑delivery amounts $11.2B (total $25.9B). For June 30 the company did not publish a separate “RPO vs conditional” line in the press release (the 10‑Q treats $30.1B as unsatisfied RPO).

A: Short answer (as of Aug 14, 2025) - Public CoreWeave statements and docs show they hold ISO/IEC 27001 and SOC 2 (Type‑2) attestations (they also list SOC 1 Type‑2 and HIPAA; a HITRUST listing is shown for a specific region/data‑center in their docs).

A: Short answer — publicly disclosed non‑OpenAI terms are limited to the Microsoft Master Services Agreement and CoreWeave’s IPO disclosures: - Microsoft MSA (filed as Exhibit 10.23; effective Feb 22, 2023) — reserved‑instance / “Reserved Instances” model (i.e., dedicated/take‑or‑pay style capacity via Order Forms), payment/upfront payment mechanics (some fields redacted), termination-for-cause only with a 45‑day cure period, termination‑period payment rules (Customer pays for services during transfer/termination period), and suspension rules (2 consecutive business days triggers cancellation of payment obligations for affected services). No general termination‑for‑convenience clause is shown in the public MSA. (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1769628/000119312525044231/d899798dex1023.htm">sec.gov</a>) - CoreWeave S‑1 / IPO filings — describe that most material customer contracts are multi‑year (2–5 years), “take‑or‑pay” in form, include customer prepayments (weighted average 15–25% of TCV) and $15.1B RPO as of Dec 31, 2024; the filings do not disclose granular minimum‑annual‑spend or step‑down guarantees or cure periods for other hyperscalers. (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1769628/000119312525067651/d899798d424b4.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com">sec.gov</a>) I did not find publicly filed, unredacted MSAs or Order Forms for other hyperscalers (AWS, Google, Meta) that disclose specific minimum‑spend, step‑down or take‑or‑pay cure details as of Aug 14, 2025. If you want, I can pull the specific MSA clauses and line references.</p>

[144] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: What days sales outstanding (DSO) and accounts receivable aging metrics did CoreWeave report for Q2 2025, and did management disclose any changes to customer payment terms or receivables concentration after quarter-end? A: Short answer — CoreWeave did not report a DSO or an accounts‑receivable aging schedule for Q2 2025. The company disclosed accounts receivable, net of $1,933,698 (thousands) as of June 30, 2025, and said payment terms are generally within 60 days (occasionally up to 360 days). It reported AR concentration: Customer A ~39%, Customer C ~25% and Customer D ~25% of accounts receivable as of June 30, 2025. I found no management disclosure of any change to customer payment terms or receivables concentration after quarter‑end in the Q2 2025 Form 10‑Q, the Aug 12, 2025 earnings release or the earnings call transcript. (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1769628/000176962825000041/crwv-20250630.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com">sec.gov</a>, <a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Reports-Strong-Second-Quarter-2025-Results?utm_source=chatgpt.com">investors.coreweave.com</a>, <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-coreweave-q2-2025-reports-revenue-surge-stock-dips-93CH-4186916?utm_source=chatgpt.com">investing.com</a>)</p>

[145] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Since July 1, 2025, how many CoreWeave data center site activations scheduled for second-half 2025 have been publicly deferred due to storage system availability or backbone network constraints, and what aggregate megawatts of capacity do those deferrals represent? A: Short answer: I could not find any public disclosure since July 1, 2025 that <em>explicitly</em> states a CoreWeave data‑center site activation scheduled in H2‑2025 was deferred specifically for “storage system availability” or “backbone network” constraints. CoreWeave’s public Q2/earnings materials and status page discuss general supply/power/network bottlenecks and storage incidents, but they do not list any named H2‑2025 site activations and MW totals that were publicly deferred for those exact reasons. (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Reports-Strong-Second-Quarter-2025-Results?utm_source=chatgpt.com">investors.coreweave.com</a>, <a href="https://status.coreweave.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">status.coreweave.com</a>) If you want, I can (a) search Core Scientific / local permitting notices and 8‑K filings for any site‑level delay notices, or (b) monitor press/IR channels and report back if/when a specific deferral is published.</p>

[146] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: What changes to EU customer terms and conditions and technical interoperability plans has CoreWeave publicly outlined to comply with the EU Data Act switching and egress fee phase-out requirements effective September 12, 2025, and what milestones or timelines through 2027 has the company disclosed? A: Short answer: CoreWeave’s public materials show three concrete moves relevant to EU Data Act switching/egress rules and a few timeline items — but I found no public, dated “Data‑Act compliance roadmap through 2027” or an EU‑specific amended T&amp;Cs document explicitly labelled as such. - Terms &amp; customer‑rights: CoreWeave’s TOS/DPA include standard export/deletion, SCCs and data‑return/deletion timeframes; CoreWeave’s pricing/docs repeatedly state “no egress” in most use cases (and its AI Object Storage launch says “no egress…fees”).

[147] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: In 2024–2025 disclosures, what proportion of CoreWeave’s projected electricity consumption is covered by power price hedging instruments or fixed-price/indexed power contracts, and what percentage of customer compute agreements include power cost pass-through or indexation clauses? A: Short answer: CoreWeave’s 2024–2025 public filings do not disclose a numeric percentage for either metric. Its S‑1/10‑Q say the company entered PPAs in 2023–2024 and report contracted power (≈1.3 GW at 12/31/2024; ~1.6 GW by 3/31/2025) and that the team “hedg(es) and risk manages power costs,” but they do not state what share of projected electricity is price‑hedged or fixed‑priced/index‑linked. Likewise, CoreWeave’s filings describe committed customer contracts and (in related Core Scientific hosting slides) that certain HPC hosting agreements treat power as a direct pass‑through, but the company does not quantify the % of customer compute agreements that include power cost pass‑through or indexation.

[148] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of August 14, 2025, what Community Benefits Agreements (CBAs), community fund commitments, or local hiring and apprenticeship targets have been publicly disclosed for CoreWeave’s Lancaster, Pennsylvania and Kenilworth, New Jersey data center projects—including dollar amounts, job creation targets, supplier diversity goals, and implementation timelines? A: Short answer — public disclosures found by Aug 14, 2025: - Lancaster, PA: CoreWeave announced an intent to commit up to $6 billion for a 100 MW (expandable to 300 MW) AI data center; public statements list ~600 construction jobs and ~70 FTEs at launch scaling to ~175 over time. No signed CBA, community‑fund dollar amount, supplier‑diversity targets, or formal local‑hire/apprenticeship quotas were detailed in the announcement. (<a href="https://investors.coreweave.com/news/news-details/2025/CoreWeave-Announces-Multi-Billion-Dollar-Commitment-to-AI-Infrastructure-in-Pennsylvania/default.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com">investors.coreweave.com</a>) - Kenilworth, NJ: CoreWeave (lease/purchase reporting) disclosed a ~$1.2B conversion investment for a 280,000 sq‑ft NEST building; planning‑board materials noted ~40 operational staff and approvals for supporting infrastructure. I did not find a publicly posted CBA, dedicated community fund, supplier‑diversity goal, or formal local‑hire/apprenticeship targets in news or meeting records.

[149] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: For facilities operated by MERLIN Properties in Barcelona and by Applied Digital that host CoreWeave workloads, what 2024–2025 PUE and WUE metrics have the facility operators published, and is there any publicly available confirmation that CoreWeave’s deployments at those sites achieve those same metrics? A: Short answer — operator claims only: - MERLIN/Edged (Barcelona): published design/operational figures are PUE = 1.15 and “zero water consumption” (WUE ≈ 0). (<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/merlin-properties-and-edged-expand-global-reach-of-new-barcelona-data-center-with-connections-to-barcelona-cable-landing-station-exa-and-axent-302030805.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">prnewswire.com</a>) - Applied Digital (Ellendale / Polaris Forge): published design figure is PUE ≈ 1.18 and “near‑zero” water consumption / WUE.

[150] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of August 14, 2025, what is CoreWeave’s debt maturity schedule by instrument and amount from 2025 through 2030, and have any maturities been amended or extended since year-end 2024? A: Short answer (as of Aug 14, 2025): - 2025: 2024 Term Loan $1.0bn (accelerated and repaid Apr 11, 2025). No material parent-level senior debt scheduled remaining in 2025.
