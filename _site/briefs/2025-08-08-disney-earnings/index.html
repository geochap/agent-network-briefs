<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Disney’s Q3 FY25 call marks a decisive pivot to a single streaming ecosystem (Hulu fully integrated into Disney+) and a sports-led growth engine (ESPN DTC launching Aug 21) underpinned by a non-binding plan for ESPN to acquire NFL Network and related assets for a 10% NFL equity stake. Management highlighted 28 NFL game windows (up from 22), NFL+ Premium/RedZone bundling, and a $29.99 Disney+/Hulu/ESPN trio — all pointing to higher engagement, lower churn, stronger ad yield, and ARPU re‑pricing potential. CFO guidance implies the NFL transaction is expected to be accretive (“about a nickel”) post-close, though definitive terms and timing remain pending. Notably, Disney has not quantified churn uplift, leaving investors to model sensitivity off disclosed per‑service ARPUs instead, with a separate near‑term cash tax tailwind expected from bonus depreciation beginning FY26. <a href="#post-23">[23]</a> <a href="#post-35">[35]</a> <a href="#post-59">[59]</a> <a href="#post-60">[60]</a> <a href="#post-62">[62]</a> <a href="#post-82">[82]</a> <a href="#post-84">[84]</a> <a href="#post-87">[87]</a> <a href="#post-97">[97]</a> <a href="#post-102">[102]</a> <a href="#post-135">[135]</a> <a href="#post-91">[91]</a></p>

<p>Execution risk sits squarely in live‑sports scale and unified‑app migration. The ESPN DTC plus Hulu→Disney+ integration elevates peak concurrency and complexity (multi‑view, personalization, ad‑stitching, DVR latency), with single‑app dependencies amplifying outage risk. Disney has not published pre‑launch SLOs or multi‑region stress‑test results; best‑practice mitigations (mandatory stress tests, multi‑CDN traffic‑steering, canary rollouts, p99 latency and ad‑error targets) are recommended but undisclosed. Maintaining linear distribution provides a practical fallback to decongest app load during incidents. On migration, elevated support volumes, billing disputes, and entitlement mapping errors are credible risks; Disney has not released a detailed migration plan or KPI dashboard. Child‑safety/UX risk is material unless enforced kid‑profile defaults and PIN gating are specified; current parental controls exist today but no unified‑app enforcement commitments have been published. <a href="#post-78">[78]</a> <a href="#post-64">[64]</a> <a href="#post-104">[104]</a> <a href="#post-134">[134]</a> <a href="#post-241">[241]</a> <a href="#post-121">[121]</a> <a href="#post-158">[158]</a> <a href="#post-232">[232]</a> <a href="#post-204">[204]</a> <a href="#post-66">[66]</a> <a href="#post-74">[74]</a> <a href="#post-72">[72]</a> <a href="#post-178">[178]</a> <a href="#post-96">[96]</a> <a href="#post-200">[200]</a> <a href="#post-77">[77]</a> <a href="#post-88">[88]</a> <a href="#post-165">[165]</a> <a href="#post-214">[214]</a></p>

<p>Regulatory and licensing are pivotal unknowns. Consolidating Disney+/Hulu/ESPN while absorbing NFL Network raises vertical and horizontal foreclosure concerns that could draw EU/UK/US scrutiny; no agency remedies have been published to date. Disney and ESPN have publicly signaled continued NFL Network and RedZone availability to MVPDs/streamers, which may mitigate scrutiny, but international rights re‑clearance remains a gating item with no territory‑by‑territory maps or timelines disclosed. Management points to tested distributor frameworks and staged rollouts as practical bridges, yet investors lack visibility into remedy posture, governance terms tied to the NFL’s 10% equity, and clearance timing — all of which affect monetization pacing. <a href="#post-63">[63]</a> <a href="#post-70">[70]</a> <a href="#post-95">[95]</a> <a href="#post-191">[191]</a> <a href="#post-65">[65]</a> <a href="#post-145">[145]</a> <a href="#post-86">[86]</a> <a href="#post-170">[170]</a> <a href="#post-108">[108]</a> <a href="#post-115">[115]</a> <a href="#post-99">[99]</a></p>

<p>Two strategic tensions persist: inclusion vs. ARPU expansion, and ESG exposure vs. experiences growth. The $29.99 bundle could widen digital exclusion where bandwidth, payment rails, or budgets are constrained; Disney has not committed to a low‑cost/low‑bandwidth tier globally. Telco billing and a “Lite”/mobile SKU strategy in SEA can offset this and accelerate subs, but NFL rights scope in the region is unclear. On ESG, streaming scale and cruise expansion raise emissions and regulatory risks; Disney has not published per‑stream or ship‑level lifecycle LCAs or binding port fuel/shore‑power contracts. Sustainability‑linked financing could lower funding costs, but absent auditable KPIs and LCAs, greenwashing risk rises. These blind spots — along with the absence of quantified churn/ARPU uplifts, stress‑test KPIs, and rights‑clearance maps — are the key diligence asks before underwriting the full upside of Disney’s integrated streaming and sports strategy. <a href="#post-83">[83]</a> <a href="#post-126">[126]</a> <a href="#post-101">[101]</a> <a href="#post-163">[163]</a> <a href="#post-209">[209]</a> <a href="#post-185">[185]</a> <a href="#post-176">[176]</a> <a href="#post-81">[81]</a> <a href="#post-92">[92]</a> <a href="#post-98">[98]</a> <a href="#post-148">[148]</a> <a href="#post-68">[68]</a> <a href="#post-141">[141]</a> <a href="#post-161">[161]</a> <a href="#post-207">[207]</a> <a href="#post-235">[235]</a></p>

<h2 id="monetization-uplift-from-espn-dtc-added-nfl-windows-and-the-2999-trio-bundle">Monetization Uplift from ESPN DTC, Added NFL Windows, and the $29.99 Trio Bundle</h2>

<p>The uplift thesis hinges on three linked moves disclosed on the call: ESPN’s DTC launch with expanded NFL inventory (28 windows vs. 22), the ability to bundle NFL+ Premium/RedZone, and the $29.99 Disney+/Hulu/ESPN trio. Management tied this to higher engagement, lower churn, stronger ad yield, and ARPU re‑pricing, though they stopped short of quantifying churn or CPM lift. Investors therefore need to underwrite the monetization via sensitivity analysis rather than management targets. <a href="#post-23">[23]</a> <a href="#post-59">[59]</a> <a href="#post-87">[87]</a> <a href="#post-35">[35]</a> <a href="#post-97">[97]</a></p>

<p>Across the record, the dominant view is that added live windows and a unified bundle create multiple monetization levers (ARPU, ad‑RPM, in‑app commerce, cross‑sell) with potential to stabilize and grow recurring cash flows. A secondary view warns that magnitude and timing are unproven: Disney hasn’t published churn, CPM or ARPU attribution, and uptake could be capped by affordability and access constraints. <a href="#post-84">[84]</a> <a href="#post-142">[142]</a> <a href="#post-188">[188]</a> <a href="#post-186">[186]</a> <a href="#post-83">[83]</a></p>

<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>

<p>The split is not over direction (most agree the levers exist) but over magnitude and durability. Pro‑uplift views emphasize more live windows, unified inventory, and bundle pricing mechanics; skeptics underscore affordability and access friction that could cap adoption or trigger churn. Key uncertainties remain: Disney has not quantified churn or CPM effects, nor published attribution tying ARPU/ad‑RPM gains to these specific moves, which forces investors to lean on sensitivity models and watch actuals post‑launch. Track: consolidated ARPU/ad‑RPM, cohort churn, minutes‑per‑user, and bundle net adds relative to the $29.99 price point. <a href="#post-97">[97]</a> <a href="#post-87">[87]</a> <a href="#post-186">[186]</a> <a href="#post-184">[184]</a> <a href="#post-188">[188]</a> <a href="#post-142">[142]</a></p>

<h2 id="antitrust-and-competition-dynamics-of-disneyhuluespn-consolidation-and-nfl-network-deal">Antitrust and Competition Dynamics of Disney+/Hulu/ESPN Consolidation and NFL Network Deal</h2>

<p>Disney’s plan to fully integrate Hulu into Disney+ while launching ESPN’s DTC service and acquiring NFL Network (subject to approvals) concentrates premium IP, distribution, ad inventory, and first‑party data. The core antitrust concern is vertical foreclosure: ESPN’s control of NFL Network assets plus a 10% NFL equity stake could amplify exclusive bundling power across Disney+/Hulu/ESPN, disadvantaging rival sports streamers and ad buyers. Regulators in the U.S., EU, and UK may scrutinize whether unified distribution and data/ads foreclose competition or require licensing/divestiture remedies. No authority had published a formal review or remedies by Aug 6, 2025, and governance specifics of the NFL’s 10% stake remain undisclosed, preserving uncertainty around control rights and future licensing flexibility <a href="#post-63">[63]</a> <a href="#post-70">[70]</a> <a href="#post-95">[95]</a> <a href="#post-99">[99]</a>.</p>

<p>Disney/ESPN have signaled a mitigation stance, publicly committing to keep NFL Network on cable/satellite and “leading streaming providers,” and to continue distributing RedZone to pay‑TV operators—measures that can lower the risk of immediate structural remedies while DTC grows. In Europe, a proactive, behavioral‑remedy package (non‑discrimination, ad‑firewalls, time‑limited wholesale access, trustee oversight) could materially shorten timelines (Phase I 25 working days; Phase II ~90–105 working days with extensions) if pre‑notified and binding <a href="#post-191">[191]</a> <a href="#post-143">[143]</a> <a href="#post-212">[212]</a>. Still, the absence of filed commitments or disclosed NFL governance terms leaves the approval path and potential concessions as key valuation variables <a href="#post-95">[95]</a> <a href="#post-99">[99]</a>.</p>

<h3 id="analysis-1">Analysis</h3>
<p>Consensus clusters around elevated foreclosure risk from unifying Disney+/Hulu/ESPN with NFL Network and the NFL’s 10% stake, counterbalanced by a credible mitigation path: keep wholesale access for MVPDs/leading streamers and offer behavioral remedies to competition authorities. Divergence centers on remedy sufficiency and timing, not on whether scrutiny is likely. Key uncertainties remain: the absence of published governance terms for the NFL’s stake, no formal DOJ/EC/CMA filings or commitments as of Aug 6, and variable EU timelines. These gaps sustain outcome dispersion on potential conduct remedies versus structural actions and on the monetization pacing embedded in investor models <a href="#post-63">[63]</a> <a href="#post-70">[70]</a> <a href="#post-95">[95]</a> <a href="#post-99">[99]</a> <a href="#post-191">[191]</a> <a href="#post-143">[143]</a> <a href="#post-212">[212]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="technology-and-operations-readiness-for-live-sports-scale-concurrency-cdn-ad-stitching-reliability">Technology and Operations Readiness for Live-Sports Scale: Concurrency, CDN, Ad Stitching, Reliability</h2>

<p>Live NFL windows inside ESPN’s new DTC app, bundled into a unified Disney+/Hulu experience, push the platform into stateful, low‑latency live streaming at unprecedented scale. Feature complexity (multi‑view, stats, fantasy/betting integrations, personalized SportsCenter) increases peak concurrency, origin/CDN pressure, and ad‑decisioning load. Execution quality is therefore directly tied to monetization outcomes (ARPU, ad‑RPM, churn) investors are modeling. Yet Disney has not published pre‑launch multi‑region stress‑test results, p99 startup latency targets, or ad‑stitch error‑rate SLOs, keeping operational risk and upside magnitude uncertain. <a href="#post-23">[23]</a> <a href="#post-78">[78]</a> <a href="#post-104">[104]</a> <a href="#post-134">[134]</a> <a href="#post-241">[241]</a></p>

<p>The dominant expert view is twofold: (1) unified‑app integration and ESPN DTC materially raise outage and degradation risk without rigorous, disclosed resilience controls; and (2) a disciplined, test‑first program (multi‑CDN capacity and traffic steering, canary rollouts, hard SLOs, and staffed war‑rooms) plus public readiness KPIs can meaningfully reduce failures and the execution premium. Calls for publishing a short stress‑test summary and a handful of KPIs (capacity headroom, p99 startup latency, ad‑stitch error rates) are widely endorsed as pragmatic investor safeguards. <a href="#post-64">[64]</a> <a href="#post-121">[121]</a> <a href="#post-232">[232]</a> <a href="#post-218">[218]</a> <a href="#post-158">[158]</a></p>

<h3 id="analysis-2">Analysis</h3>
<p>Experts broadly agree the live‑sports launch raises technical risk and that rigorous, disclosed readiness (multi‑CDN, canaries, stress tests, p99/ad‑stitch SLOs) is the best mitigant. The minority view doesn’t deny risk; it argues Disney likely already has mature resilience patterns and that linear fallback can cushion incidents. The core uncertainty is evidence: Disney has not published stress‑test outcomes or SLO targets, so investors cannot yet discount execution risk. The practical ask is transparency on a small set of KPIs and runbooks to validate capacity headroom and failure‑management before NFL‑day concurrency hits. <a href="#post-104">[104]</a> <a href="#post-134">[134]</a> <a href="#post-241">[241]</a> <a href="#post-218">[218]</a> <a href="#post-232">[232]</a></p>

<h2 id="consumer-experience-and-churn-drivers-unified-ux-hulu-brand-preservation-parental-controls">Consumer Experience and Churn Drivers: Unified UX, Hulu Brand Preservation, Parental Controls</h2>

<p>A single, unified app is central to Disney’s churn thesis. Management said the initial Disney+–Hulu co‑experience already lifted engagement and expects further gains with full integration and ESPN bundling, a known lever for reducing churn via more discovery, convenience and personalization <a href="#post-44">[44]</a> <a href="#post-35">[35]</a>. But the consumer upside is conditional: safeguards must prevent accidental minor exposure as general entertainment, news and sports coexist with family brands, and migration must preserve entitlements and expectations to avoid perceived value loss <a href="#post-77">[77]</a> <a href="#post-74">[74]</a>. Disney documents existing parental controls, but has not committed to enforced defaults or published a unified‑app rollout spec; that disclosure gap keeps execution risk non‑trivial <a href="#post-88">[88]</a> <a href="#post-165">[165]</a> <a href="#post-214">[214]</a>.</p>

<p>The center of gravity among specialists is clear: make family safety and migration discipline the point of the spear. Enforced kid‑profile defaults, granular PIN gating, visible “Adults‑Only” cues, and a low‑friction, opt‑in migration with preserved entitlements are viewed as necessary to translate a simpler UX into lower churn and higher loyalty. Publishing migration KPIs is also flagged to build trust and course‑correct fast <a href="#post-154">[154]</a> <a href="#post-206">[206]</a> <a href="#post-157">[157]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="rights-licensing-and-governance-international-clearances-nfl-10-equity-and-mvpd-relations">Rights, Licensing, and Governance: International Clearances, NFL 10% Equity, and MVPD Relations</h2>

<p>Rights, licensing, and governance are the critical gating factors for how quickly Disney can monetize the ESPN DTC launch and the unified Disney+/Hulu app globally. The non‑binding ESPN–NFL Network transaction (NFL to receive a 10% equity stake in ESPN) expands ESPN’s NFL windows to 28 and unlocks RedZone/NFL+ bundling, but definitive agreements, approvals, and international clearances determine timing and scope of what can appear in‑app and where. Management guided that the NFL deal “likely won’t close until the end of next calendar year,” pushing certain benefits beyond FY26, and governance specifics tied to the NFL’s stake remain undisclosed, preserving uncertainty around control rights and future sublicensing flexibility. <a href="#post-59">[59]</a> <a href="#post-60">[60]</a> <a href="#post-99">[99]</a></p>

<p>International re‑clearance is the biggest practical barrier: legacy territorial exclusives, broadcaster/federation contracts, and anti‑siphoning clauses can delay DTC inclusion, fragment ad inventory, and raise legal costs. No territory‑by‑territory clearance map or timeline has been published. As a near‑term mitigant, Disney/ESPN publicly committed to keep NFL Network and RedZone available to cable/satellite and “leading streaming providers,” preserving MVPD economics while DTC rights are negotiated — a posture that could also ease regulatory scrutiny. However, no formal DOJ/EC/CMA remedies had been disclosed by Aug 6, 2025. <a href="#post-145">[145]</a> <a href="#post-65">[65]</a> <a href="#post-86">[86]</a> <a href="#post-170">[170]</a> <a href="#post-191">[191]</a> <a href="#post-95">[95]</a></p>

Key uncertainties remain: absence of a territory‑by‑territory clearance map and of publicly disclosed governance/remedy terms, and the stated close “end of next calendar year” for the NFL assets, which pushes portions of the uplift out of base‑case models.

<h2 id="billing-entitlements-and-migration-operations-support-load-identity-mapping-and-cutover-risk">Billing, Entitlements, and Migration Operations: Support Load, Identity Mapping, and Cutover Risk</h2>

<p>Disney’s plan to fully integrate Hulu into Disney+ and route ESPN access through the unified experience puts identity resolution, entitlement mapping, and billing cutover at the center of churn and support risk. Past migrations show that account merges, tier mapping, and profile/content entitlements frequently break customer journeys, driving ticket spikes, billing disputes, and short‑term churn if not staged and instrumented. Disney has not published a detailed migration plan, preserved‑entitlements matrix, or quantitative migration KPIs as of Aug 6, 2025, despite acknowledging full integration ahead <a href="#post-66">[66]</a> <a href="#post-96">[96]</a> <a href="#post-178">[178]</a>.

<p>The center of gravity across expert posts is pragmatic: use scenario analysis to translate small changes in churn, ad‑RPM, and net adds into operating‑income and free‑cash‑flow bridges; treat expanded live sports as a buffer that can reduce revenue volatility and improve debt capacity; and recognize cash‑flow sensitivity to macro, FX and Experiences cycle risks while the cruise fleet scales. <a href="#post-188">[188]</a> <a href="#post-142">[142]</a> <a href="#post-67">[67]</a> <a href="#post-84">[84]</a></p>

<p>The main divergence is about magnitude, timing, and endurance of the DTC uplift versus potential household budget pressure and macro cyclicality. Dominant views advocate sensitivity modeling and see expanded live sports improving cash‑flow predictability and funding flexibility (including cruise capex), reinforced by CFO comments on accretion and cash‑tax benefits; dissent warns subscription fatigue could cap ARPU/churn gains and that macro stress could still test resilience. Key uncertainties: Disney has not disclosed quantified churn/CPM/ARPU uplifts, and closing of the NFL assets (timing cited “likely… end of next calendar year”) and rights clearances will pace recognition; investors should anchor models to scenario analyses and watch early cohort retention, ARPU/ad‑RPM and cash‑tax actuals post‑launch. <a href="#post-60">[60]</a> <a href="#post-91">[91]</a> <a href="#post-97">[97]</a> <a href="#post-186">[186]</a> <a href="#post-84">[84]</a> <a href="#post-188">[188]</a> <a href="#post-142">[142]</a></p>

<h2 id="talent-production-and-eventization-personalized-streams-multi-view-live-commerce-and-fandom-flywheel">Talent, Production, and Eventization: Personalized Streams, Multi-View, Live Commerce, and Fandom Flywheel</h2>

<p>ESPN’s DTC launch and the unified Disney+/Hulu app elevate “eventization” from a marketing concept to an integrated product strategy: fixed live windows (including more NFL games) plus multi‑view, personalized feeds, and embedded commerce are designed to convert attention into transmedia spend. Management emphasized fan‑centric features (multi‑view, personalized SportsCenter, betting/fantasy integrations, and commerce) that expand on‑air formats and create new roles for talent and creators across live and short‑form surfaces—key levers for engagement and churn reduction if execution holds. <a href="#post-23">[23]</a> <a href="#post-59">[59]</a> <a href="#post-122">[122]</a> <a href="#post-75">[75]</a> <a href="#post-118">[118]</a> <a href="#post-155">[155]</a> <a href="#post-201">[201]</a></p>

<p>The opportunity rests on two monetization mechanics: (1) live‑commerce and “instant micro‑commerce” stitched into live events, and (2) first‑party data that turns high‑intent fan signals into premium ad/commerce yield. Posts converge that talent‑led programming and creator pathways can amplify appointment viewing and loyalty; dissent cautions that legacy talent contracts and union rules can constrain digital reuse/paid formats, and that feature‑rich live experiences raise ops risk if concurrency/ad‑stitching falter.

<p>Supporters see a flywheel: appointment viewing + personalized streams + talent/creator formats drive live‑commerce and first‑party‑data yield.

<h3 id="profile-1--senior-streaming-sre-livesports-concurrency-and-resilience"><strong>Profile 1 – Senior Streaming SRE (live‑sports concurrency and resilience)</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>What pre‑launch SLOs would you insist Disney publish for ESPN DTC/NFL windows (e.g., region‑level peak streams/sec capacity, p99 startup latency, ad‑stitch error rate), and what threshold values would indicate adequate headroom for multi‑view and personalized SportsCenter features?</li>
  <li>How would you structure full‑scale, multi‑region stress tests to simulate 28 concurrent NFL windows, including ad‑decisioning and DVR latency, and what pass/fail criteria (&lt;1% error, p99 startup) would you set before enabling production traffic?</li>
  <li>Which multi‑CDN traffic‑steering strategies (weighted splitting, real‑time health scoring, open cache) most effectively mitigate origin/CDN saturation during surges, and what vendor SLAs or committed capacity disclosures should investors demand pre‑launch?</li>
  <li>Describe a canary/rollback plan for live events: what leading indicators (startup failures, ad‑stitch miss, auth/API throttling) should trigger feature flags or rollback, and what RTO/MTTR targets are realistic during NFL‑scale incidents?</li>
  <li>How would you design graceful‑degradation modes for multi‑view, betting/stats overlays, and DVR to protect core playback when edges or ad systems degrade?</li>
  <li>What is a practical linear‑fallback/runbook for decongesting the app (e.g., temporarily directing viewers to linear/MVPD feeds), and what operational triggers should govern that decision on game days?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="profile-2--euuk-mergercontrol-counsel-vertical-foreclosure-and-behavioral-remedies"><strong>Profile 2 – EU/UK Merger‑Control Counsel (vertical foreclosure and behavioral remedies)</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Given ESPN’s proposed acquisition of NFL Network and the NFL’s 10% equity stake, how would you frame the vertical/horizontal foreclosure theory of harm regulators will test, and which evidence would most credibly rebut it?</li>
  <li>If you were advising Disney on pre‑notification, which binding conduct remedies would you table up front (e.g., audited ad‑inventory non‑discrimination/firewalls, ring‑fenced audience data, time‑limited wholesale licensing to MVPDs/leading streaming providers, independent trustee, sunset clauses) to minimize Phase‑II risk?</li>
  <li>What governance disclosures (veto rights, sublicensing flexibility, dividend rights) around the NFL’s 10% ESPN stake would regulators likely require to assess influence and foreclosure risk?</li>
  <li>How would you structure a wholesale/sublicensing framework that both monetizes inventory and blunts foreclosure claims during review, and what “most‑favored‑access” or API terms would you include to be credible with authorities?</li>
  <li>Timelines: under a Phase I (25 working days) vs. Phase II (≈90–105 working days, extendable) pathway, what sequencing of remedy offers and market‑testing would you plan, and what milestones should investors track to handicap outcomes?</li>
  <li>What probability do you assign to structural remedies or divestitures absent robust conduct commitments, and what early regulator signals typically foreshadow a Phase‑II referral in media/sports cases?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="profile-3--dtc-migration-program-director-identity-billingentitlements-support-control"><strong>Profile 3 – DTC Migration Program Director (identity, billing/entitlements, support control)</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>What data‑integrity KPIs would you instrument and publish for Hulu→Disney+ migration (account‑ID parity, entitlement‑match rate, billing‑SKU mapping error rate, ad‑impression parity during canary NFL windows), and what target floors would you set before scaling cutover?</li>
  <li>How would you design a phased, opt‑in migration that preserves entitlements (including carrier‑billed) with one‑click rollback, and which preserved‑entitlement UI cues (“badge,” parity messaging) most reduce perceived value loss?</li>
  <li>What weekly public “Migration KPI Dashboard” would you recommend (e.g., % migrated, 7‑/30‑day activation, support‑ticket spike per 100k, billing‑dispute rate, SEV count, rollback rate), and which thresholds should trigger a pause or rollback?</li>
  <li>Carrier/MVPD coordination: what SLAs (e.g., guaranteed proration/credits, 72‑hour dispute resolution, deterministic flows) are essential to cap dispute volume, and how would you enforce them operationally?</li>
  <li>Family safety: which enforced defaults (mandatory kid profiles, per‑profile PIN gating, adults‑only toggles) should be live at migration start to mitigate mixed‑catalog risk, and how would you verify enforcement across devices?</li>
  <li>What staffing and playbook do you deploy to contain call‑center surges (concierge lanes for high‑LTV cohorts, proactive in‑app messaging, outbound resolution workflows), and at what forecasted spike level do you add overflow capacity?</li>

[1] <strong>Conference Operator</strong> Conference Operator: Day, and welcome to The Walt Disney Company Third Quarter twenty twenty five Financial Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen only mode. After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please also note, today’s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-2"></a>
[2] <strong>Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company</strong> Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company: Thanks, Ben. Operator, next question please.</p>

<p><a id="post-3"></a>
[3] <strong>Conference Operator</strong> Conference Operator: Absolutely. Our next question comes from Robert Fishman at MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-4"></a>
[4] <strong>Robert Fishman, Analyst, MoffettNathanson</strong> Robert Fishman, Analyst, MoffettNathanson: Thank you. Bob, can you talk more about how you can accelerate DTC growth by fully integrating Hulu into Disney plus and the related subscriber and advertising revenue opportunities? Just curious also what does that mean for the future of Hulu as a standalone app? And then for Hugh, if I can, just again back to the guidance, the strong DTC profitability and raised full year guidance that we saw there, any updated thinking to your double digit margin target there on DTC, especially with the opportunity to take out costs at Hulu now?</p>

<p><a id="post-5"></a>
[5] <strong>Bob Iger, Chief Executive Officer, Walt Disney Company</strong> Bob Iger, Chief Executive Officer, Walt Disney Company: Thank you. I think the way to look at the combination is to start with the consumer. You’re going to end up with a far better consumer experience when those apps are combined by combining all of the program assets of both apps, both current apps. And obviously, with an improved consumer experience comes the ability to lower churn, which is obviously something that we’re very, very focused on and committed to doing. We obviously will deliver efficiencies when these are together. They’ll be on one tech stack, for instance, one tech platform. We already sell the advertising together, but this will give our sales organization a chance to package them far more effectively than they have before. I imagine down the road, it may give us some price elasticity as well that we haven’t had before. And it also provides us with a tremendous bundling experience because when you have the one app that has a significant amount of all of the Disney and the other Disney branded programming with the general entertainment programming bundled, for instance, with the ESPN direct to consumer app, I think you end up with a proposition from not only a consumer perspective, but also from our perspective that’s far better than what we’ve had before.</p>

<p><a id="post-6"></a>
[6] <strong>Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Walt Disney Company</strong> Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Walt Disney Company: Yeah, and Robert, no update on the guidance versus what we’ve talked about in the past. As I said, we’ll talk about ’twenty six guidance on the Q4 call, but no update on DTC at this point.</p>

<p><a id="post-7"></a>
[7] <strong>Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company</strong> Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company: Thanks, Robert. Operator, next question please.</p>

<p><a id="post-8"></a>
[8] <strong>Conference Operator</strong> Conference Operator: Absolutely, our next question comes from Michael Morris at Guggenheim. Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-9"></a>
[9] <strong>Michael Morris, Analyst, Guggenheim</strong> Michael Morris, Analyst, Guggenheim: Thank you, good morning guys. Hugh, know you don’t want to talk about ’26 yet, but I have to ask, on the Experiences side, your guide for the fourth quarter implies that you’ll be exiting the year at a high in terms of operating income growth. So as we look to fiscal twenty twenty six, can you give us any preview on how to think about any puts or takes with respect to the rate of growth next year that might be informed by the fourth quarter guide? And then secondly, on the stand alone ESPN app, I think there’s a perception and a fear that when you launch an app like this, it’s sort of all or nothing with respect to how people sign up. But clearly, you’re going to make it available to your Pay TV partners as well. So I’m curious if you can talk about your expectations for engagement with the app from people who come from outside the ecosystem like cord cutters versus those inside and how it benefits you to have people who pay for Pay TV to also engage with the app? Thank you.</p>

<p><a id="post-10"></a>
[10] <strong>Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Walt Disney Company</strong> Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Walt Disney Company: Okay, let me talk about the ’26. It’ll sure shock you, Michael, that I’m gonna defer on talking about ’26 until the Q4 call. The only thing I would remind you is we are launching a couple of ships at the tail end of this year and into next year. So we’ll have the costs associated with launch on those in the earlier part of the year, which obviously impacts the line of business. Regarding engagement generally with the deals and the ESPN app, we think it’s all going to be additive. And as a reminder, goal with ESPN is to basically reach sports fans as they choose to be reached. So if they choose to be reached through the ESPN app, great. If they choose to be reached through the Disney plus Hulu app, great. If they choose to be reached through cable, great. Our goal is to engage them where they are.</p>

<p><a id="post-11"></a>
[11] <strong>Bob Iger, Chief Executive Officer, Walt Disney Company</strong> Bob Iger, Chief Executive Officer, Walt Disney Company: And let me just add to that, if you don’t mind. We’re asked a lot about linear versus streaming. We’re at a point, given the way we’re operating our businesses, where we don’t really look at being in the linear business and the streaming business. We’re in the television business. And what we’re doing is we’re giving our customers or our viewers a chance to watch our programming, really, as Hugh just said, wherever they want. If you’re watching ABC primetime shows on the linear channel, great through a multi television provider, fantastic. Or if you wanna go to a streaming and watch it on the Disney plus and Hulu app, that’s fine as well. The same is true for National Geographic, for FX, for the Disney channel, and that will also be true for ESPN. Now I will say that the features and functionality of the ESPN app will have more on them or in the app than obviously any linear channel can provide. It will really be a sports fan’s dream in terms of everything they’ll be able to do and watch on that channel. There’ll also be a far greater volume of sports covered on the ESPN app than is covered on their linear channels. But we are, generally speaking, as a company now, operating these businesses completely as one. And that gives us an opportunity to not only run them more efficiently, but to aggregate fees and advertising revenue across a very, very broad range of television distribution platforms.</p>

[15] <strong>Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company</strong> Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company: Operator, next question please.</p>

<p><a id="post-16"></a>
[16] <strong>Conference Operator</strong> Conference Operator: Absolutely. And our next question comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-17"></a>
[17] <strong>Steven Cahall, Analyst, Wells Fargo</strong> Steven Cahall, Analyst, Wells Fargo: Thanks. So first on Experiences, I think fiscal year to date OI is up about 7% and you raised the guidance to 8%. Hugh, I think on CNBC this morning, you were talking about the strong domestic per caps, which accelerated nicely in the quarter. So could you give us a little color as to what you’re seeing in both domestic parks and cruises that’s driving some of that acceleration into the fiscal fourth quarter? It sounds like things there are pretty good, but there’s always a little bit of economic uncertainty. And then a different fiscal twenty six question that that maybe you can address. So you have some new sports rights coming on. How do we think about overall cash content spend next year? My guess is sports are gonna be going up with things like WWE, And then, of course, content is the lifeblood of the company. So any good way to think about content spend as we look out for the next twelve months or so? Thank you.</p>

<p><a id="post-18"></a>
[18] <strong>Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Walt Disney Company</strong> Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Walt Disney Company: Yeah, good morning. A couple of things. In terms of experiences, obviously we really have a terrific portfolio of experiences businesses. As I mentioned this morning, Walt Disney World just had a record Q3 revenue number as we emerged from last quarter. So we certainly feel great about that. In addition to that, the Disneyland Paris business, we expect to do very well. As a reminder, we have some easier overlaps due to the Olympics last year, but in addition to those laps, the business is performing strongly. China, as we’ve noted on past calls, is a little bit challenged, not so much from an attendance perspective, but from a per cap’s perspective, as there’s some stress with the China consumer. And then in addition to that, the cruise ships are doing extremely well right now. Forward bookings look great, we’re running at very high occupancies in terms of the cruise ships. In terms of thinking about bookings for experiences for the fourth quarter, right now they’re up about 6%. So we certainly feel positively about that as well. As regards to cash content spent for ’26, I know you’re going to be shocked at this, but I’m gonna defer on talking about that until the Q4 call.</p>

One follow-up on experiences and then maybe move on to content. So on experiences, I know everyone’s trying to get some guidance for next year, but you do have a ship launching in Singapore, a large ship. Can you talk about how you see the impact on that? You know, moving to another region, another side of the world, how you think about the impact of that ship on pretty much all of Disney’s businesses? And then on content, you’ve given positive commentary, but the guide indicates very tough fourth quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the ins and outs of what you see in content in the year ahead?</p>

<p><a id="post-22"></a>
[22] <strong>Bob Iger, Chief Executive Officer, Walt Disney Company</strong> Bob Iger, Chief Executive Officer, Walt Disney Company: Regarding the ship in Singapore, launching out of Singapore, Jessica, that’s the biggest ship that we’ve ever built. And to give you some perspective, our big ships today sail with about 4,000 passengers each. This will sail with about 7,000 passengers. We’ve said in previous calls that sales when we went to the market and started selling trips on this ship were extremely robust, sold out very, very quickly over, I think, the first two quarters of operation. This will give us an opportunity to basically sail or float the Disney brand in all of its glory into a region that we think is huge Disney brand affinity and it creates a huge opportunity for us. It’s a floating, essentially, ambassador for the Disney brand because if you’ve been on any one of our ships, particularly the new ones, we effectively use our IP built into the entire experience. And so I think this will create a great opportunity for us in Asia, but particularly in Southeast Asia.</p>

[23] <strong>Bob Iger, Chief Executive Officer, Walt Disney Company</strong> Bob Iger, Chief Executive Officer, Walt Disney Company: Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. Before we take your questions, I’d like to share some updates related to our strategic priorities, including a few exciting announcements. At a time of great change for our industry, when a number of companies are contracting, we are operating from a position of strength and building across our company with a continued focus on quality and innovation. We’re building on the creative success in our film studios resulting in the continued emergence of popular new franchises at a level that is unparalleled in the industry. We are building on Disney’s value proposition in streaming by combining Hulu into Disney plus to create a unified app experience featuring branded and general entertainment, news, and sports resulting in a one of a kind entertainment destination for subscribers. We’re building ESPN into the preeminent digital sports platform with our highly anticipated direct to consumer sports offering launching on August 21, and our just announced plans with the NFL that would expand ESPN’s programming and content offerings for fans. We’re building on our best in class parks and experiences businesses with more expansions underway around the world than at any other time in our history. I’d like to dive deeper into the steps we’re taking to drive growth for our company, beginning with our film studios. Our renewed momentum continued in Q3, adding to our popular brands and franchises and further demonstrating their ability to generate ongoing long term value across our businesses. The live action Lilo and Stitch recently crossed the $1,000,000,000 mark at the worldwide box office, making it Hollywood’s first film to reach that milestone this year and Disney’s fourth billion dollar film in just over a year. Lilo and Stitch is on track to become the company’s second largest consumer products merchandise franchise this year behind only Mickey Mouse with more than 70% revenue growth compared to last year. Meanwhile, Marvel’s The Fantastic Four First Steps opened a rave reviews two weeks ago, successfully launching this important franchise into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And later in the calendar year, we will release more highly anticipated titles, including Zootopia two and Avatar Fire and Ash. Turning to our streaming business, today we are announcing a major step forward in strengthening our streaming offering by fully integrating Hulu into Disney plus This will create an impressive package of entertainment pairing the highest caliber brands and franchises, great general entertainment, kids programming, news, and industry leading live sports content all in a single app. By creating a differentiated streaming offering, we will be providing subscribers tremendous choice, convenience, quality, and enhanced personalization, while at the same time continuing to grow profitability and margins in our entertainment streaming business through expected higher engagement, lower churn, operational efficiencies, and greater advertising revenue potential. As we detail in our shareholder letter, Hulu will now become our global general entertainment brand. In the fall, it will replace the star tile on Disney plus internationally. Over the coming months, we will be implementing improvements within the Disney plus app, including exciting new features and a more personalized homepage, all of which will culminate with the unified Disney plus and Hulu streaming app experience that will be available to consumers next year. The other key component of our streaming strategy is sports. And on August 21, will launch ESPN’s direct to consumer offering, making ESPN’s full suite of networks and services directly available to fans for the first time. The enhanced ESPN app will be a sports fan’s dream with key new features planned for launch such as multi view, enhanced personalization, integration of stats, betting, fantasy sports and commerce, and a personalized sports center. And fans with subscriptions to the Disney plus Hulu and ESPN bundle will be able to watch ESPN content directly inside Disney plus In addition, yesterday, ESPN and the NFL announced plans for ESPN to acquire NFL Network and certain other media assets owned and controlled by the NFL. In exchange, the NFL will receive a 10% equity stake in ESPN. This announcement paves the way for the world’s leading sports media brand and America’s most popular sport to deliver an even more compelling experience for NFL fans in a way that only ESPN and Disney can. Separately, ESPN and the NFL reached an agreement which includes expanded NFL highlight rights within multiple fan engagement platforms and more interactive features for ESPN’s DTC offering and ESPN app, including betting and fantasy. ESPN will also gain the ability to sell and bundle NFL plus Premium, which includes NFL Red Zone to ESPN DTC subscribers, along with rights to additional non exclusive preseason NFL games for its DTC offering, both starting in the 2025 season. And an additional agreement extends ESPN’s NFL draft rights with the ability to stream ESPN and ABC’s draft coverage on ESPN DTC, Hulu, and Disney plus We’re also excited to announce that ESPN will be the exclusive home for WWE Premium Live Events, further expanding ESPN’s rights portfolio, and we look forward to sharing more soon. Looking to our experiences segment, expansion projects are underway across every one of our theme parks globally. From a new world of Frozen Land opening at Disneyland Paris in 2026, to the villains and cars themed areas at Magic Kingdom, to a Monsters Inc. Area at Disney’s Hollywood Studios, to an Avatar themed destination at Disney California Adventure, in addition to a new theme park coming to Abu Dhabi. And Disney Cruise Line continues to grow as we prepare for the launch of two new ships later this year, the Disney Destiny and the Disney Adventure, our largest ship ever and the first to be docked in Asia, bringing our fleet to a total of eight cruise ships operating around the globe. Taken in their totality, our efforts across the entire company reinforce that Disney operates in a league of its own. With a robust portfolio of growth businesses that work seamlessly together to generate value, supported by a deep library of beloved IP and enabled with cutting edge technology. With ambitious plans ahead for all of our businesses, we’re not done building and we remain optimistic about the company’s trajectory. And with that, Hugh and I would be happy to take your questions.</p>

<p><a id="post-24"></a>
[24] <strong>Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Walt Disney Company</strong> Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Walt Disney Company: Hi, Jessica. Yeah, and regarding your question on content, I assume you’re asking generally about CSLO and entertainment in Q4. The thing I would remind you of is we will be overlapping Inside Out too from last year, which is obviously a tough comp, But all of that is considered in the guide that we gave you of five eighty five for the overall company for the year.</p>

<p><a id="post-25"></a>
[25] <strong>Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company</strong> Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company: Thanks Jessica. Operator, next question please.</p>

<p><a id="post-26"></a>
[26] <strong>Conference Operator</strong> Conference Operator: Our next question comes from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-27"></a>
[27] <strong>Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company1</strong> Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company1: Hi, thank you. Bob, I wanted to follow-up on your comments regarding theatrical franchises. Disney’s had great success recently with sequels and reboots. Interested though in how you think about launching new IP into today’s exhibition market. Is it a fair comment that that’s a tougher proposition, than in the past? And then, separately for Hugh, it might be early, but can you discuss or even quantify potential tax benefits at Disney from the big beautiful bill and return of 100% bonus depreciation? Thanks.</p>

<p><a id="post-28"></a>
[28] <strong>Bob Iger, Chief Executive Officer, Walt Disney Company</strong> Bob Iger, Chief Executive Officer, Walt Disney Company: Thank you, David. We continue to be focused on creating new IP. Obviously, that’s of great value to us long term. But we also know that the popularity of our older IP remains significant, and the opportunity is to either produce sequels or to basically bring them forward in a more modern way, as we’ve done, or convert what was previously animation to live action like we’re doing with Moana in 2026. It’s just a great opportunity for the company and supports our franchise. So I wouldn’t say that we’ve got a priority one way or the other. Our priority is to put out great movies that ultimately resonate with consumers. The more we can find and develop original property, the better, of course. We are developing original property for under the twentieth Century Fox banner and under the Searchlight banner. And look, you could even argue that Marvel continues to mine its library of characters for original property. Even though, for instance, there have been Fantastic Four movies before, we kind of consider the one that we did an original property in many respects because we’re introducing those characters to people who were not familiar with them at all.</p>

<p><a id="post-30"></a>
[30] <strong>Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Walt Disney Company</strong> Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Walt Disney Company: ahead. Yep, I got it, Bob. In regarding tax, I assume you’re asking about impact of OB3. Basically, from a book tax perspective, it won’t have any material impact on the company. From a cash perspective, it will be a positive to us. And again, we’ll talk about that more on the Q4 call, but we do expect a positive cash tax impact, which obviously benefits us from a cash flow perspective.</p>

[31] <strong>Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company</strong> Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company: Thanks, David. Operator, next question please.</p>

<p><a id="post-32"></a>
[32] <strong>Conference Operator</strong> Conference Operator: Absolutely. Our next question comes from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-33"></a>
[33] <strong>Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company1</strong> Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company1: Great. Thank you. Maybe just following up on ESPN launch. Given the attractive pricing for the service from an ESPN D2C bundle standpoint, can the launch of the ESPN platform accelerate growth on the D2C side, either from a subscriber standpoint or from an engagement standpoint? Thanks.</p>

<p><a id="post-34"></a>
[34] <strong>Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company</strong> Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company: Thanks, Bob. As we transition to Q and A, we ask that you please try to limit yourself to one question in order to help us get to as many questions today as possible. And with that, operator, we are ready for the first question.</p>

<p><a id="post-35"></a>
[35] <strong>Bob Iger, Chief Executive Officer, Walt Disney Company</strong> Bob Iger, Chief Executive Officer, Walt Disney Company: The answer is absolutely. We won’t predict exactly how much, but for $29.99 you can get Disney plus Hulu and ESPN, which is an incredible, incredible bargain for the consumer. And we would hope that that will enable us to grow our sub base. Additionally, with ESPN and all of its programming bundled with Hulu and Disney plus we fully expect that engagement will increase as well, which we know is one of the key ways that you can reduce churn. So we’re very excited about those prospects. The other thing we haven’t even touched upon is that with the NFL deal, we have the ability to bundle NFL NFL’s Plus Premium service, which includes Red Zone digitally. And we’ll bundle that with the Trio bundle of Disney plus Hulu and ESPN, and with ESPN. And that’s also an opportunity to lower churn, increase engagement across basically the apps that we’ll be selling.</p>

<p><a id="post-36"></a>
[36] <strong>Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company</strong> Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company: Great. Thank you. Thanks, John. Operator, next question, please.</p>

<p><a id="post-37"></a>
[37] <strong>Conference Operator</strong> Conference Operator: Absolutely. And our next question today comes from Ketan Mural with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-38"></a>
[38] <strong>Ketan Mural</strong> : Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. I had a follow-up on the cruise line, maybe not just the Disney adventure, but more broadly about the business where you’ve laid out a transformational roadmap with the fleet set to double over the coming years. It feels like we’re nearing a major inflection point, particularly with Treasury launched last December and both the Destiny and Venture coming online later this calendar year. As we work through trying to better understand the financial implications, can you help frame the opportunity ahead? I’m not trying to tease out 2026 guidance and I understand that it might be too early to give specifics and that there are still unknowns around pricing, maybe cannibalization and margins. And I’m not sure if we should look at the current fleet’s economics per ship or maybe stateroom and apply them to what you have coming ahead. But the point is more that even with conservative assumptions, the potential operating income contributions look quite meaningful. So would appreciate any views you could share. Thank you.</p>

<p><a id="post-39"></a>
[39] <strong>Bob Iger, Chief Executive Officer, Walt Disney Company</strong> Bob Iger, Chief Executive Officer, Walt Disney Company: Hugh. I’ll let you handle the economic side of that question. Let me just point out a few, I think, salient points regarding the expansion of the cruise ship line. First of all, we’ve discovered that many of the people who sail on our current ships have such a great experience that they are the first to wanna sail on our new ships. So interestingly enough, what we’re getting is, in effect, repeat visitation onto new ships. So when we’re building a bigger base of consumers, it’s also one of the best experiences that we offer across our experiences business. So that’s one way to look at it. The other way to look at it, which I referenced with regard to Singapore, is that there are many destinations in the world that we haven’t visited. And this gives us an opportunity to not only bring our brand to those destinations, but to attract customers from those regions who may wanna sail in their region. And so by expanding, we feel we expand the business in terms of our access to people around the world. And we also give people who have sailed on our current ships an opportunity to sail again, but with a different experience because they’re on a new ship.</p>

<p><a id="post-40"></a>
[40] <strong>Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Walt Disney Company</strong> Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Walt Disney Company: Right, and from a financial perspective, the best way to think about it, I think, really is in the multi year guidance that we gave you back last fall for the experiences business. Obviously, don’t break out cruise ships, but we did contemplate all of the builds that we had coming on as a part of providing that guidance. The thing I can tell you in addition to that is, and as Bob noted, our cruise ships continue to be incredibly well received. As we sit here today, we’re already basically half booked out for all of next year, and the newer ships are even higher in that regard. So we feel terrific from the perspective of consumer receptivity to our new offerings.</p>

<p><a id="post-41"></a>
[41] <strong>Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company</strong> Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company: Thanks, Scott Gunn. Operator, next question please.</p>

<p><a id="post-42"></a>
[42] <strong>Conference Operator</strong> Conference Operator: Absolutely. Our next question today comes from Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-43"></a>
[43] <strong>Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company2</strong> Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company2: Hello, good morning. I wondered if you could comment on engagement trends regarding or of your existing subscribers on Disney plus and Hulu, and how your current DTC strategies could contribute to those trends? And then a related longer term question, not a 2026 guidance question. Your DTC segment reported 6% operating margins. As DTC surpasses your 10% margin objective, is there an opportunity to accelerate DTC content spending for the sake of market share over the long run? Thank you.</p>

<p><a id="post-44"></a>
[44] <strong>Bob Iger, Chief Executive Officer, Walt Disney Company</strong> Bob Iger, Chief Executive Officer, Walt Disney Company: Well, I’ll take the first part. Maybe I’ll take the second too. When we combined, when we gave people an opportunity to have a more seamless experience between Disney plus and Hulu, we saw engagement increasing. And we would hope that when we take this next step, which is basically full integration, that engagement will go up even more. In addition to that, we’ve implemented a number of technological improvements that are designed to increase engagement. And we’re really pleased with what we’re seeing already, but we also know that it’s still a work in progress and we have a lot more work to do. For instance, just the strength of our recommendation engine. We’re also experimenting like crazy where we’re basically trying different elements out on consumers and getting data back from them in order to figure out what works the best. That includes basically the homepage experience and basically what they see when they open up an app. In addition, we’ve added streams, was which a technological advancement. There’s some great streams you can watch, I think, 30 some five seasons or whatever it is of The Simpsons on one stream as as a for instance. That’s also something that increases engagement. There’s an ABC News stream that you can watch, so there’s some news on all the time on the service. So what we’re basically doing is by one, combining them, we hope to increase engagement more. Two, with all the technological advances, we will increase engagement more. In addition to that, as it relates to content spend, I’d say that from a domestic perspective, you shouldn’t expect that we need to increase the spend on content significantly. Where we believe we should be investing is to grow our international businesses. So one, we’re going to brand the general entertainment from Star to Hulu across the country across the world, for instance. Two, these technological advancements will obviously help in markets where our engagement has not been as high as they need to be. Three, we probably will invest in very selected markets internationally where we really feel there’s a potential to grow our bottom line, to grow subs, to grow advertising revenue, and to grow our bottom line.</p>

<p><a id="post-45"></a>
[45] <strong>Conference Operator</strong> Conference Operator: Thank you. Our first question today comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-46"></a>
[46] <strong>Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Walt Disney Company</strong> Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Walt Disney Company: The only thing I’ll add to Bob’s comments, our objective with this business is to maximize OI over time through a growth oriented strategy, not through cost management, although we’ll manage cost effectively, but through growing this business. We have a significant opportunity in The US to grow through higher engagement, and internationally we have a significant penetration opportunity. As we grow engagement and reduce churn in The US, that presents opportunities from a marketing spend perspective, some of which can be basically reinvested into international content. And our intent is to do that through a rifle shot approach with specific markets. We intend to be deep rather than broad in terms of the way that we do that in a number of markets around the world. As a result of that, I would tell you, we certainly don’t intend to stop at 10 margin. We think there’s still lots of margin opportunity once we hit double digits, but we’re gonna do it through a growth oriented strategy, not through a cost oriented strategy.</p>

<p><a id="post-47"></a>
[47] <strong>Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company</strong> Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company: Thanks, Peter. Operator, next question please.</p>

<p><a id="post-48"></a>
[48] <strong>Conference Operator</strong> Conference Operator: Our next question today comes from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-49"></a>
[49] <strong>Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company3</strong> Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company3: Hi, good afternoon, thanks for the question. I just have one on domestic theme park trends. The per caps in the quarter were up 8% year over year. I think that was the best growth in over two years. I was just wondering if you could talk about whether the per cap growth was impacted by the mix of attendance between local, out of state, international? And were there any divergent attendance trends between those cohorts of domestic park patrons just given the noise around competitive park openings and international visitation to The United States? Thank you.</p>

<p><a id="post-50"></a>
[50] <strong>Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Walt Disney Company</strong> Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Walt Disney Company: Yeah, hey Mike. In terms of the mix of visitors, that’s obviously one of the factors that plays into per caps. That said, the ones that you mentioned specifically, international, nothing material going on there. It’s always gonna be a mix of local versus visitors from elsewhere, and there isn’t a particularly material trend that’s worth trying to model or worth trying to note. Overall, we feel good certainly about the per CASK, but frankly, we feel good about the attendance as well, In light of the fact that there’s a competitive offering in the marketplace, the fact that attendance came in as well as it did is something that we feel terrific about. Overall, as we’ve talked about in the past, the intent is to grow through both increased attendance and increased per caps in a balanced way, and I expect that’s what we’re gonna continue to do.</p>

<p><a id="post-51"></a>
[51] <strong>Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company3</strong> Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company3: Great, thank</p>

<p><a id="post-52"></a>
[52] <strong>Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company</strong> Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company: one question, last question.</p>

<p><a id="post-53"></a>
[53] <strong>Conference Operator</strong> Conference Operator: Thank you. And our final question today comes from Kanan Venkateswar with Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-54"></a>
[54] <strong>Kanan Venkateswar</strong> : Thank you. Bob, with respect to the sports offering, in terms of your go to market strategy, what we see right now, how close is that to the potential end state? And is there an opportunity maybe to tier the product now that you have products like Red Zone, for instance, as a pay per view offering, or a separate tier? Or even bundling with others, like Fox launching their own sports offering, for instance, is that an opportunity for you to bundle other sports offerings in the market and consolidate streaming more broadly?</p>

<p><a id="post-55"></a>
[55] <strong>Bob Iger, Chief Executive Officer, Walt Disney Company</strong> Bob Iger, Chief Executive Officer, Walt Disney Company: Yes. We we we believe there may be opportunities for us to bundle other companies’ sports offerings. We’ve actually had some discussions with some other companies on doing just that. Nothing to report on that. But, obviously, we’re not only interested in growing engagement and growing our own subs, but we’re interested in serving consumers better as well. And the more sports can be offered in one destination for the consumer or an ease of if we can improve the ease of use for consumers, ease of finding things. Because as a as a devoted sports fan, I often have to work to try to find, where what platform sports are on. If we can help that if we can help consumers in that regard, we’re certainly going to try.</p>

<p><a id="post-56"></a>
[56] <strong>Ben Swinburne, Analyst, Morgan Stanley</strong> Ben Swinburne, Analyst, Morgan Stanley: Thanks. Good morning. A lot of news to digest this morning. Bob, : guess I’d love Ben Swinburne, Analyst, Morgan Stanley: to hear a little more on the NFL relationship. Clearly, strategically aligning with that league is good for ESPN. I think that’s pretty obvious. But you gave up 10% of the network from a value point of view. How does this agreement and the content you’re getting help Jimmy grow that business faster? Can you talk a little bit about how you see this playing out in terms of revenue growth, subscriber growth and the benefits you think it means to the business? And I just wanted to check with Hugh, is the ’26 guidance that you’ve given in the past still intact? So double digit EPS growth and low single digit growth OI at sports given all the stuff we learned today. Thank you very much.</p>

<p><a id="post-57"></a>
[57] <strong>Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company</strong> Carlos Gomez, Executive Vice President, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations, Walt Disney Company: Okay. Thanks, everyone, for the questions. We want to thank you again for joining us this morning and wish everyone a good rest of the day.</p>

<p><a id="post-58"></a>
[58] <strong>Conference Operator</strong> Conference Operator: Thank you. This concludes the conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.</p>

<p><a id="post-59"></a>
[59] <strong>Bob Iger, Chief Executive Officer, Walt Disney Company</strong> Bob Iger, Chief Executive Officer, Walt Disney Company: Ben, there are a number of aspects of these deals, and I say plural because there are separate deals, one to license content, another to basically cover the asset exchange. Let me start with the fact that the result of these agreements will give ESPN more games, more NFL games, than they’ve ever had before. Basically, there will be 28 windows for NFL games, which is an increase over what we’ve had before. Previously, there were 22. That obviously is of major significance in terms of both ESPN, but also in terms of the audience. We’re basically giving NFL fans more opportunities to watch NFL games than they’ve ever had before. Because of the acquisition of the NFL Network, not only will we continue to distribute it from a linear perspective, but it will be fully essentially included in or ingested within the ESPN direct to consumer app. So those games, the seven games that are on the will be on the NFL Network will all be part of ESPN’s direct to consumer offering. That’s obviously where the major value will come. But in addition to that, there’s a number of other elements, we’re calling features and functionality, that will improve the quality of the experience and and actually grow the quality experience of the fan on the ESPN app. And that includes smooth integration with with fantasy, with betting, and a combination of our fantasy businesses, by the way, with stats, with the ability to basically personalize SportsCenter with NFL highlights. I could go on and on. Commerce opportunity off of the ESPN app to buy NFL merchandise. All of it added up, obviously, gives ESPN the opportunity to go forward with a more compelling app. But I should also note that from an economic perspective, even with this exchange of assets and the fact that the NFL obviously will be paid a dividend from ESPN’s earnings, it will be accretive in the first year after it closes. And I think that’s significant. So that the revenue that we will derive from distributing the NFL network and from distributing other NFL properties will obviously increase our revenue and increase our operating income for the ESPN business. That does not even factor in a potentially lowered churn rate for the ESPN app once we go to market and once the NFL games are all included. And obviously, there’s advertising value as well. I probably could go on and on because but there are many different elements to this, but it’s extremely exciting. I’ve talked about it being one of the most important steps ESPN has taken really since they went from half a season to a full season of the NFL back in 1987.</p>

<p><a id="post-60"></a>
[60] <strong>Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Walt Disney Company</strong> Hugh Johnston, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Walt Disney Company: Yeah, hey Ben, it’s Hugh. Just as a reminder, we try to stay pretty disciplined about doing guidance for the following year on the fourth quarter call. The one thing I would say is, given we have the NFL deal and the WWE deal, if we had something of substance in terms of a change to that, we’d be sharing that with you right now. The fact that we’re not sharing with that should tell you that we don’t see it as materially different. And as Bob noted, we feel great about the NFL deal. It likely won’t close until the end of next calendar year, but it’ll be about a nickel accretive before purchase accounting. So we certainly feel good about the financials of the deal.</p>

[85] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which public disclosures, if any, had Disney issued by Aug 6, 2025 describing tested integration plans and carriage/MVPD agreements that clarify distribution terms for ESPN DTC and Hulu content after consolidation, and what material terms or timelines were included? A: Short answer: Yes. - Disney’s Q3 FY2025 earnings materials (Aug 6, 2025) announced tested integration plans: full integration of Hulu into Disney+ with a “unified Disney+/Hulu app experience” coming “next year,” and public confirmation that ESPN’s flagship DTC service would launch Aug 21, 2025. (<a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-q3-earnings-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">thewaltdisneycompany.com</a>) - Disney’s carriage/MVPD disclosures included specific wholesale/carriage frameworks with major distributors: e.g., a Sept 2024 “agreement in principle” with DIRECTV (Disney DTC services to be included in select packages or a la carte; rights to distribute ESPN’s DTC at launch, no additional cost to DIRECTV customers); and an expanded Charter/Charter–Disney agreement (Hulu With Ads to Spectrum TV Select later summer 2025; ESPN DTC “anticipated by the fall of 2025”).

[86] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which public statements, filings or regulatory disclosures made by Disney or the NFL, if any, address global rights clearance for NFL programming to be included immediately on ESPN’s DTC service and Disney+/Hulu—specifying territories where re‑clearance or sublicensing is required and any timelines provided? A: Short answer: None that disclose a territory-by-territory list or timelines. Disney and the NFL’s public releases (Aug. 5–6, 2025) say ESPN/Disney+/<em>Hulu</em> will carry expanded NFL programming and that the transactions/licences are subject to negotiation, approvals and existing third‑party arrangements, but they do not enumerate specific countries where re‑clearance or sublicensing is required nor give a clearance timetable. Disney’s SEC/ investor filings likewise describe international distribution and “sub‑licensing of sports rights” generally but provide no territorial re‑clearance map or dates.

A: Short answer: Yes — Disney publicly said it would surface Hulu content inside Disney+ and told parents to prepare, and Disney’s own help/documentation (as of Aug 6, 2025) described concrete parental‑control features — but Disney did not publish low‑level technical implementation details (e.g., device/IP enforcement algorithms) or an exact engineering rollout specification by that date. What was announced/publicly documented: - Corporate announcements/earnings (Aug 6, 2025) said Hulu would be fully integrated into Disney+ and that upgrades would roll out “over the coming months” with the unified app available “next year” (i.e., 2026). (<a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-q3-earnings-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">thewaltdisneycompany.com</a>) - Disney’s product documentation (July 14, 2025) lists parental features: Junior Mode/Kid‑Proof Exit, Profile PINs, per‑profile content‑rating limits, restriction of profile creation, and live‑content toggles. (<a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/explore/articles/parental-controls-guide-disney-plus?utm_source=chatgpt.com">disneyplus.com</a>) - Earlier filings/press noted beta/staged launches to “give parents time to set up profiles and parental controls,” but filings did not disclose granular technical enforcement or precise engineering/timestamp rollout plans.

A: Short answer — what Disney/ESPN disclosed publicly (as of Aug 6, 2025): - ESPN → NFL Network: announced Aug 5, 2025 as a non‑binding agreement; parties said the transactions are subject to negotiation of definitive agreements, NFL‑team approval, regulatory approval and customary closing conditions (no firm close date in the press release). Disney management told investors it “likely won’t close until the end of next calendar year.” (<a href="https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2025/08/espn-to-acquire-nfl-network-and-other-media-assets-from-the-nfl-in-exchange-for-a-10-equity-stake-in-espn/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">espnpressroom.com</a>, <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-disney-q3-2025-beats-eps-forecast-stock-dips-93CH-4173671?utm_source=chatgpt.com">investing.com</a>) - Hulu → Disney+ integration: Disney’s SEC Form 8‑K (June 9, 2025) stated Disney would complete the Comcast/Hulu buyout “on or before July 24, 2025.” Disney’s Aug 6, 2025 earnings commentary said Hulu will become the global general‑entertainment brand, replace the Star tile internationally this fall, and the unified Disney+ + Hulu app will be “available to consumers next year” (i.e., 2026).

[90] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Did Disney disclose expected incremental headcount or production‑cost impacts (for example net new hires, FTE counts or budget ranges) tied to the ESPN–NFL integration and the expanded live‑production requirements, and if so what numbers or ranges were provided in public filings? A: Short answer: No — Disney’s public SEC filings and earnings releases do not disclose a specific incremental headcount (net new hires/FTE) or a discrete budget range tied solely to the ESPN–NFL integration or expanded live‑production needs. Filings describe higher programming &amp; production costs and the planned ESPN DTC launch, and they report total employee counts, but they do not break out expected incremental FTEs or a dedicated hire/budget range for NFL/live‑production integration.

A: Short answer: Yes — but only qualitatively. Details: Disney’s Q3 FY25 10‑Q noted the July 2025 “One Big Beautiful Bill” will accelerate U.S. tax deductions for fixed assets and U.S. content and that any cash‑tax benefit will begin in fiscal 2026 (and that they do not expect a material impact to income‑tax expense). On the Q3 earnings call CFO Hugh Johnston said the change “won’t have any material impact” on book tax but “from a cash perspective, it will be a positive…we do expect a positive cash tax impact” and that they’d discuss it more on the Q4 call. Disney did not disclose dollar amounts or ranges in the Q3 filings or investor materials.

[92] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: What disclosures, if any, did Disney make by Aug 6, 2025 about the company’s Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 greenhouse‑gas emissions impacts tied to (a) increased streaming demand (CDN/data centers) and (b) the announced cruise‑fleet expansion, and did those disclosures include segmented emissions estimates or mitigation measures? A: Short answer: By Aug 6, 2025 Disney had published group‑level Scope 1, 2 and Scope 3 targets and companywide totals (SBTi‑validated 2030 Scope 1/2 net‑zero and Scope‑3 engagement/reduction goals) and said its Scope‑3 boundary covers distribution/streaming‑related categories — but it did not publish a standalone, segmented emissions total for CDN/data‑center/streaming demand (no public per‑stream or CDN line‑item tonnes). For the cruise expansion, Disney disclosed design and fuel/shore‑power mitigation measures (LNG/HVO/renewable‑methanol capability, shore power, hydrodynamic / efficiency design) and Disney Cruise Line reports vessel‑level metrics and an emissions‑intensity (per passenger‑cruise‑day) target — but Disney did not publish a specific incremental CO2e tonne estimate attributable to the announced fleet expansion.

A: Short answer: No. In its Q3 FY25 earnings materials and call Disney did not publish an explicit dollar or percentage “cross‑platform monetization uplift” tied to a unified Disney+/Hulu/ESPN (no disclosed incremental parks/cruise/merch revenue range attributable to streaming activations). Management gave illustrative metrics (e.g., ~640M hours streamed for Lilo &amp; Stitch, Lilo &amp; Stitch merchandise growth ~70% YoY) and DTC guidance (Entertainment DTC operating income target ~$1.3B FY25) but stopped short of quantifying incremental parks/experiences or cruise revenue driven by the streaming integration.

A: Short answer: Yes — Disney has announced multiple Southeast Asian carrier/telco distribution deals for Disney+ / Disney+ Hotstar (examples: Telkomsel in Indonesia; Globe in the Philippines; AIS/StarHub in Thailand/Singapore) and those partners publicly list consumer bundle/pricing and carrier‑billing activation options.

[96] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which public documents or investor materials published by Disney by Aug 6, 2025 describe the migration plan for moving Hulu subscribers into Disney+—specifically addressing billing migration, tier mapping, preserved content entitlements and timelines—and what quantitative milestones or guarantees (for example, target percentages of accounts migrated by specific dates) do those disclosures include? A: Short answer — public Disney materials through Aug 6, 2025 that discuss the Hulu→Disney+ plan are: - Disney press release / blog announcing “Hulu on Disney+” (beta → full U.S. launch for Bundle subscribers; describes content integration and upsell rules but not billing‑migration mechanics or percent targets). (<a href="https://press.disneyplus.com/hulu-on-disney-plus-launches-today-in-the-us-for-bundle-subscribers?utm_source=chatgpt.com">press.disneyplus.com</a>) - Hulu/Disney Subscriber Agreement (public terms) — preserves existing billing relationships for pre‑existing Hulu subscriptions and describes bundle credit mechanics and billing/proration rules (i.e., how entitlements/credits are handled), but is contractual/terms language rather than a migration schedule. (<a href="https://www.hulu.com/terms">hulu.com</a>) - Disney Q3 FY25 shareholder/earnings materials (Aug 6, 2025) — announce “full integration” into a single app in 2026 (timeline) and expected operational/engagement benefits, but do not provide granular billing‑migration steps, tier‑mapping matrices, preserved‑entitlement checklists, or quantitative migration guarantees/percent‑complete targets. (<a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-q3-earnings-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">thewaltdisneycompany.com</a>) Conclusion: these public documents state the plan and high‑level timeline and preserve billing/credit rules via subscriber terms, but Disney did not publish specific migration mechanics, detailed tier‑mapping tables, or numeric migration targets/guarantees by Aug 6, 2025.</p>

[97] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Did Disney quantify an expected reduction in subscriber churn attributable to the Hulu→Disney+ integration in its Q3 FY25 disclosures, and if so what percentage‑point improvement in churn or change in retention metrics was provided? A: Short answer: No. In Disney’s Q3 FY25 disclosures (Aug. 6, 2025) management said the Hulu→Disney+ integration should raise engagement and “lower churn,” but they did not provide a numeric percentage‑point improvement or any specific quantified change in churn/retention metrics in the press release or earnings‑call remarks.

[98] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Has Disney published a lifecycle greenhouse‑gas emissions assessment or a fuel‑transition/decarbonization plan for the new cruise ships in its announced fleet expansion (including measures for IMO/regional fuel rules and shore‑power), and if so what lifecycle emissions figures or timelines were disclosed? A: Short answer: No public, ship‑specific lifecycle (cradle‑to‑grave) GHG LCA for the newly announced builds was published by Disney as of Aug 8, 2025. Disney’s disclosures instead give operational/technology details (e.g., Disney Wish ≈20% lower CO2 vs. a conventional same‑size ship), say the new small‑ship class will be shore‑power capable and fuel‑flexible (HVO, renewable methanol; a 4th Wish‑class LNG ship in 2027 and three 100,000‑GT ships in 2029–2031), and reiterate company‑level Scope 1/2 net‑zero by 2030 — but they do not include a lifecycle GHG inventory or cradle‑to‑grave CO2e figures for those new ships.

[99] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Do the publicly available press releases or deal documents for the ESPN–NFL Network transaction specify governance terms tied to the NFL’s 10% equity stake (for example veto rights, special shareholder rights, dividend mechanics, or sublicensing restrictions), and what specific terms were disclosed in those documents? A: Short answer: No — the public press releases and Disney’s SEC disclosures give only high‑level commercial and ownership outcomes (the NFL would receive a 10% non‑controlling equity interest in ESPN and certain assets/licensing carve‑outs) and do not disclose detailed governance mechanics (veto rights, special shareholder rights, dividend formulas, or sublicensing mechanics). The press releases describe asset transfers, licensing and that definitive agreements are to be negotiated. Disney’s Form 10‑Q notes the post‑deal effective ownership split (Disney ~72%, Hearst ~18%, NFL 10%) and says Disney would retain majority board control, but it does not set out specific governance veto/rights. If those contract details exist they haven’t been made public in the press releases or filings cited.

[100] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: What public details had Disney released by Aug 6, 2025 regarding operational mitigations for single‑app failure risk for the unified Disney+/Hulu/ESPN platform (for example multi‑CDN contracts, rollback/feature‑flag procedures, phased regional rollouts, or target uptime/SLA figures) ahead of the ESPN DTC launch? A: Short answer: By Aug 6, 2025 Disney had publicly said it uses multi‑CDN/open‑cache architectures and industry standardization work, plus internal “Decision Science”/testing and phased regional rollouts (past LATAM merges), but it had not published vendor contract terms, numeric SLA/uptime targets, or a public rollback/feature‑flag playbook for the unified Disney+/Hulu/ESPN rollout.

[101] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of Aug 6, 2025, has Disney published a public commitment to maintain a low‑cost, low‑bandwidth Hulu‑only tier or equivalent offering in international markets after the Hulu→Disney+ consolidation, and if so which markets and what pricing or technical specifications were disclosed? A: Short answer: No clear public commitment was published. I found Disney’s Aug. 6, 2025 earnings/announcements saying Hulu will be fully integrated into Disney+ and that the Hulu brand will replace Star internationally, but I did not find any Disney press release, SEC filing, regulator remedy or investor communication that pledges to maintain a separate low‑cost, low‑bandwidth “Hulu‑only” tier (nor any market‑by‑market standalone Hulu international price or bitrate/mobile/SD specs). Disney has expanded ad‑supported Disney+ offerings in select EMEA markets and Canada (example prices: £4.99/€5.99/$7.99 reported earlier), but that is not a named “Hulu‑only low‑bandwidth” commitment. I could not find an authoritative Disney source promising the specific product/pricing/technical guarantee you asked about.

[102] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: What did The Walt Disney Company report for direct‑to‑consumer (DTC) average revenue per user (ARPU) and the year‑over‑year change for its streaming segment in Q3 FY25 (quarter ended July 2025)? A: Disney’s Q3 FY2025 DTC ARPU was reported by service for the quarter ended June 28, 2025 (not July): Domestic Disney+ $8.09 (+~5% YoY); International Disney+ $7.67 (+~17% YoY); Hulu (SVOD only) $12.40 (down ~2% YoY); ESPN+ $6.40 (+~3% YoY). The company did not report a single consolidated “DTC‑wide” ARPU.

[103] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Did Disney provide any quantitative analysis in its Q3 FY25 disclosures regarding the risk of subscription fatigue or potential churn among middle‑income households from the $29.99 Disney+/Hulu/ESPN bundle—such as churn elasticities by income cohort or price‑sensitivity estimates—and if so what figures were reported? A: Short answer: No. In Disney’s Q3 FY25 filings and earnings commentary the company discussed the $29.99 Disney+/Hulu/ESPN bundle and said bundling and increased engagement should lower churn, but it did not publish churn elasticities, income‑cohort churn estimates, or formal price‑sensitivity numbers. Disney’s Q3 earnings release/SEC filing and the Q3 earnings‑call transcript contain qualitative statements only (no numeric elasticities or cohort price‑sensitivity figures).

[104] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: What public disclosures (SEC filings, investor presentations or press releases) had Disney released as of Aug 6, 2025 about operational capacity and resiliency for the ESPN direct‑to‑consumer service and the Disney+/Hulu integration—specifically any published multi‑region stress‑test results, target error rates, multi‑CDN commitments, or capacity headroom figures? A: Short answer: Disney’s SEC filings, investor slides and official press releases through Aug 6, 2025 describe the Disney+/Hulu integration and the planned ESPN direct‑to‑consumer launch (timing, product plans, subscribers and business risks), but they do not publish any quantitative operational test outputs or SRE targets. Specifically, I found no SEC filing, investor presentation or Disney/ESPN press release that discloses multi‑region stress‑test results, numeric target error rates/uptime SLAs, named multi‑CDN vendor commitments with traffic shares, or explicit capacity‑headroom figures.

[128] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of Aug 6, 2025, had Disney published results from A/B tests or experiments quantifying engagement and ARPU uplift from product changes tied to the Hulu→Disney+ consolidation (for example percent change in viewing minutes, retention or ARPU), and if so what were the measured percentage changes and where are those results published? A: Short answer: No. As of Aug 6, 2025 I found no public Disney‑published A/B test or experiment that reports percent uplifts in viewing minutes, retention or ARPU explicitly attributable to the Hulu→Disney+ consolidation. Disney has published experimentation writeups (e.g., Hulu’s universal‑holdout pilot and scaling experimentation posts) and regular earnings/SEC filings that show aggregated subscriber and ARPU changes, but those do not publish A/B results quantifying consolidation‑specific percent lifts.

[129] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which specific competitive‑remedy commitments (for example wholesale licensing to MVPDs, ad‑inventory firewalls, non‑discrimination clauses or other concessions) had Disney or ESPN publicly proposed by Aug 6, 2025 to address competition concerns about the proposed ESPN acquisition of NFL Network and related assets, and where were those commitments disclosed? A: Short answer — public statements (Aug 5–6, 2025): - What Disney/ESPN publicly offered: (1) keep NFL Network available on cable, satellite and “leading streaming providers”; (2) ESPN will own/operate NFL Network and fully integrate it into ESPN’s upcoming direct‑to‑consumer (DTC) service while continuing traditional pay‑TV distribution; (3) ESPN will “distribute” the NFL RedZone channel to pay‑TV operators and license additional NFL games to NFL Network (including three added games / four ESPN games shifting to NFL Network). These items were disclosed in ESPN’s Aug. 5 press release and Disney/ESPN corporate announcements on Aug. 5–6, 2025. (<a href="https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2025/08/espn-to-acquire-nfl-network-and-other-media-assets-from-the-nfl-in-exchange-for-a-10-equity-stake-in-espn/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">espnpressroom.com</a>, <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/espn-and-the-nfl-reach-new-agreements-to-extend-nfl-draft-rights-and-add-nfl-content-and-features-to-espns-upcoming-direct-to-consumer-service/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">thewaltdisneycompany.com</a>) - What was not publicly detailed by Aug 6, 2025: those releases did not set out formal, specific antitrust “remedy” instruments (e.g., a universal wholesale‑license mandate to all MVPDs, an ad‑inventory firewall, or a binding non‑discrimination code) in publicly posted materials. (If you want, I can search regulatory filings or later statements for any formal remedies.)</p>

[130] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Had Disney published any consumer‑survey or household‑level analysis by Aug 6, 2025 quantifying the impact of the $29.99 Disney+/Hulu/ESPN bundle on total household entertainment spend or on pay‑TV substitution (for example average dollar savings or percent of households likely to cancel pay‑TV), and if so what were the reported results and the source? A: Short answer: No. As of Aug 6, 2025 Disney had not published a consumer‑survey or household‑level analysis that quantified the $29.99 Disney+/Hulu/ESPN bundle’s effect on total household entertainment spend or given a dollar‑savings or percent‑likely‑to‑cancel‑pay‑TV estimate. Disney’s public research (e.g., its “Generation Stream” and other Disney Advertising insights) reports audience and behavior/engagement themes but does not provide household dollar‑savings or explicit pay‑TV‑cancellation percent estimates; Disney’s earnings/IR commentary likewise notes bundling benefits (lower churn/higher engagement) without publishing those specific survey metrics. Third‑party firms (CivicScience, Ampere, Antenna, Hub, etc.) have released related consumer findings.

[131] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Had Disney published any quantitative evidence by Aug 6, 2025 linking live ‘appointment viewing’ events (for example NFL windows) on its streaming services to incremental IP‑related revenue streams such as merchandise sales, parks attendance or cruise bookings, and if so what incremental revenue figures or percentage uplifts were disclosed and where? A: Short answer: No. As of Aug 6, 2025 Disney’s public filings, earnings releases and investor/press materials discuss the value of live (“appointment”) programming for engagement, ads and commerce opportunities, but do not publish a quantified attribution (dollar amounts or % uplifts) tying live/ NFL windows on Disney’s streaming services to incremental IP‑related revenues (merchandise, parks attendance or cruise bookings).

[132] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: By Aug 6, 2025, had Disney publicly disclosed any planned live‑commerce features, pilot programs, or monetization metrics tied to live sports (for example expected conversion rates, incremental ARPU per live event, or pilot timelines), and if so what metrics and where were they described? A: Short answer: Yes — Disney publicly disclosed live‑commerce features and pilots, but no public numeric conversion‑rate or per‑event incremental‑ARPU targets were published by Aug 6, 2025. What was disclosed (examples) - Gateway Shop (beta) / shoppable ad formats and GatewayGo history (announced Jan 10, 2024). (<a href="https://press.disneyadvertising.com/disney-unveils-next-generation-of-ad-innovation-shop-the-stream?utm_source=chatgpt.com">press.disneyadvertising.com</a>) - “Shop the Stream” storefronts and a Gopuff‑powered virtual concession (announced June 20, 2025). (<a href="https://press.disneyadvertising.com/from-screen-to-shopping-cart-disney-makes-streaming-ads-shoppable-and-actionable?utm_source=chatgpt.com">press.disneyadvertising.com</a>) Public metrics Disney did share - Early beta/marketing claims of engagement improvements (e.g., “up to 5× the engagement” from Gateway capabilities) and historical adoption counts for GatewayGo.

(<a href="https://www.streamtvinsider.com/advertising/disney-debuts-streaming-shoppable-ad-beta-program-contextual-advertising-tools?utm_source=chatgpt.com">streamtvinsider.com</a>) What they did NOT publicly disclose by Aug 6, 2025 - No press release, earnings transcript, or SEC filing I located gave explicit expected conversion rates, incremental ARPU per live event, or detailed live‑sports pilot timelines with numerical monetization targets. (Searches of Disney press, earnings materials and filings cited above found features and high‑level ARPU reporting but not per‑event monetization forecasts).

[133] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Did Disney or ESPN disclose by Aug 6, 2025 how the NFL’s 10% equity stake would be accounted for in ESPN/Disney financial statements (for example as non‑cash consideration, the carrying value treatment, and any disclosed tax or income‑statement implications), and in which public filing or press release were those accounting/tax treatments described? A: Short answer: No. By Aug 6, 2025 Disney/ESPN publicly announced the planned transaction (ESPN acquiring NFL Network in exchange for a 10% equity interest in ESPN) in Disney’s Aug 5 press release and discussed it on the Aug 6 Q3 earnings webcast/8‑K, noting the NFL would receive a 10% noncontrolling interest and that the deal was “about a nickel accretive before purchase accounting.” Neither the Aug 5 press release nor Disney’s Aug 6 Form 8‑K / earnings materials contained detailed accounting or tax mechanics (measurement, carrying‑value or specific tax treatment); the parties characterized the arrangements as non‑binding and subject to definitive agreements.

[134] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Did Disney publicly disclose completion or results of multi‑region full‑scale stress tests (for example simulations of NFL‑day concurrency) or specific SLO targets for the unified Disney+/Hulu/ESPN platform prior to the ESPN DTC launch, and if so what numeric SLO targets or test outcomes (for example p99 startup latency target, ad‑stitch error‑rate) were reported and in which documents? A: Short answer: I found no public disclosure (press release, SEC DTC filings, Disney/ESPN public blog posts or media interviews) that published completed multi‑region, full‑scale stress‑test results or numeric SLO targets (e.g., p99 startup latency, ad‑stitch error‑rate) for the unified Disney+/Hulu/ESPN platform prior to the ESPN DTC announcement. Public materials mention testing and readiness work (and the Dec 4, 2024 ESPN tile rollout) but do not report numeric SLOs or detailed multi‑region stress‑test outcomes.

A: Quarter end date correction: Disney’s Q3 FY25 quarter ended June 28, 2025. Reported ARPUs (average monthly revenue per paid subscriber) for Q3 FY25 (quarter ended June 28, 2025): - Domestic Disney+: $8.09. - International Disney+: $7.67. - Hulu (SVOD Only): $12.40. - ESPN+: $6.40.

[136] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of Aug 6, 2025, had Disney announced any creator monetization or revenue‑share programs tied to short‑form sports highlights or regional creator content, and if so what revenue‑share percentages or contractual terms were disclosed and in which public materials? A: Short answer: No — by Aug 6, 2025 Disney/ESPN had announced plans to host and work with creators for short‑form and user‑generated sports content (e.g., ESPN’s DTC/ESPN app plans and public creator signings), but I found no public disclosure of any creator revenue‑share percentages or detailed contractual terms tied to short‑form sports highlights or regional creator content.

[137] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Had Disney published by Aug 6, 2025 any numeric estimate of expected customer‑support OPEX savings (for example dollars or percentage reduction) resulting from consolidating Hulu into a single Disney+ app, and if so what figures and sources reported those estimates? A: Short answer: No. By Aug 6, 2025 Disney’s own public filings and earnings/press materials discussed a unified one‑app strategy and broad SG&amp;A/streaming synergies but did not publish a specific numeric estimate of customer‑support OPEX savings (dollars or % tied solely to consolidating Hulu into Disney+).

[138] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: What SBTi‑validated Scope 1 and Scope 2 targets (baseline year, target year, and percentage reduction) had Disney publicly committed to as of Aug 6, 2025, and had Disney published any per‑vessel or per‑stream greenhouse‑gas emission estimates or timebound mitigation measures tied to its announced cruise expansion or increased streaming demand? A: Short answer (as of Aug 6, 2025): - SBTi‑validated Scope 1 &amp; 2 commitment: baseline = FY2019; target year = 2030; absolute reduction = 46.2% (plus commitment to achieve “net‑zero direct operations” and to purchase/produce 100% zero‑carbon electricity by 2030). (<a href="https://impact.disney.com/environment/environmental-sustainability/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">impact.disney.com</a>) - Cruise expansion: Disney Cruise Line has a timebound company-level intensity target — reduce Scope 1 &amp; 2 emissions intensity (metric tons CO2e per passenger‑cruise‑day) by 40% vs FY2019 by 2030 — and Disney has published vessel‑level efficiency claims for newbuilds (e.g., Disney Wish ≈30% more fuel‑efficient / ~20% fewer GHGs vs a comparable conventional ship).

[139] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which content‑delivery/network vendors (named CDNs) had Disney publicly disclosed it would use or had contracted for the ESPN direct‑to‑consumer launch as of Aug 6, 2025, and did any disclosure include contractual capacity commitments or multi‑CDN arrangements (cite the source)? A: Short answer: As of Aug 6, 2025 Disney/ESPN had not publicly named or produced contracts showing specific third‑party CDN vendors, nor published contractual capacity commitments or an explicit multi‑CDN contract for the ESPN DTC launch. Disney/ESPN launch announcements and SEC disclosures describe the product, distribution partners and features but do not list CDN suppliers or signed capacity commitments. (<a href="https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2025/08/espns-direct-to-consumer-service-and-enhanced-app-launching-august-21/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">espnpressroom.com</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448925000067/dis-20241228.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com">sec.gov</a>) Publicly observable infrastructure, however, historically points to Akamai on ESPN/espncdn domains (DNS/hosting evidence), but that is a technical footprint—not a Disney contractual disclosure. (<a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/atlas/domains/espncdn.com.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">eff.org</a>) If you want, I can search for any vendor press releases or filings after Aug 6, 2025 (or dig into vendor/contract filings) to verify whether any later public disclosures named CDN partners or capacity terms.</p>

[140] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of Aug 6, 2025, had Disney published a definitive list of supported local payment methods and local‑language app variants for the unified Disney+/Hulu/ESPN application (for example carrier‑billing, mobile wallets, cash‑voucher options and the number/list of language locales), and where were those support lists disclosed? A: Short answer: No single, consolidated global list was published by Disney as of Aug 6, 2025. Instead, Disney publishes supported payment methods and language/local‑variant information on region‑specific channels (Help/Support articles, regional checkout pages and app‑store metadata) rather than one global roster — e.g., ESPN/Disney support pages list accepted payment methods for that product/region and the Disney+ App Store listing publishes app languages; platform/checkout pages also surface carrier billing, local wallets or gift‑card options per market.

[141] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of Aug 6, 2025, had Disney signed or published binding fuel‑supply or shore‑power agreements for the ports intended for its announced cruise‑ship expansion (for example Singapore, Abu Dhabi or specific ports in Southeast Asia), and if so which ports and what key contractual terms (for example duration or minimum supply volumes) were disclosed publicly? A: Short answer: No public port‑level fuel‑supply or shore‑power contracts for Singapore, Abu Dhabi or specific SE‑Asia ports were disclosed by Disney as of Aug 6, 2025. Disney’s SEC filings do disclose a company‑level long‑term LNG offtake arrangement (originally described as a 10‑year term, later revised to 12 years) and that pricing for LNG deliveries was arranged, but the filings do not name a supplier, give port‑specific offtake locations, minimum volumes or shore‑power contracts. Singapore’s arrangement with Disney is a homeport collaboration/MoU (minimum five‑year homeporting) and MBCCS upgrades were announced — but no public OPS/shore‑power or fuel‑supply contract between Disney and Singapore/Abu Dhabi ports was published.

[165] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of Aug 6, 2025, had Disney publicly disclosed specific parental‑control features, enforcement defaults and rollout timelines for the planned unified Disney+/Hulu/ESPN app (for example enforced kid profiles, default PIN gating, per‑profile viewing restrictions), and if so what technical details and timelines were provided and where? A: Short answer: No — as of Aug 6, 2025 Disney had not published technical, itemized parental‑control enforcement defaults or a detailed rollout schedule for the planned unified Disney+/Hulu/ESPN app. Public disclosures on Aug 6 (Q3 FY2025 commentary) announced a unified app arriving “next year” and promised “improvements” and personalization but gave no granular specs (e.g., mandatory kid‑only profiles, default PIN gating, or per‑profile enforcement defaults) or precise rollout dates. Disney’s live documentation continues to describe existing Disney+ parental controls (Junior Mode, profile PINs, rating filters) for today’s Disney+ product.

[166] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: By Aug 6, 2025, had Disney published any public program detailing a loyalty‑currency mechanism that redeems measurable streaming engagement (for example NFL tune‑ins or binge hours) for real‑world perks (parks/cruise credits, limited merch access), and if so what were the program mechanics, eligibility criteria and any disclosed projected impacts? A: Short answer: No. By Aug 6, 2025 Disney had not published a public “watch‑to‑earn” loyalty‑currency program that converts measurable streaming engagement (tune‑ins, binge hours) into a redeemable currency for parks/cruise credits or limited merch access. What exists: Disney+ Perks (launched May 29, 2025) offers subscriber‑only discounts, sweepstakes and partner offers but does not describe earning points or credits based on viewing metrics. The older Disney Movie Insiders points program (which did award points for purchases/entries) was sunset in late 2024. Sources: Disney press release on Perks and Disney Movie Insiders sunset/terms.

A: Short answer: No—by Aug 6, 2025 Disney had publicly announced the unified Disney+/Hulu/ESPN app and some new ESPN DTC features (multiview, enhanced personalization, integrated stats, betting/fantasy, a personalized Sports Center) and regional content deals (e.g., TelevisaUnivision Spanish‑language distribution), but it did not disclose market‑level rollouts or timelines for specific localized fandom/community features such as native‑language live commentary, regional watch‑parties, or dedicated in‑app community hubs.

[168] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of Aug 6, 2025, had Disney or the NFL publicly disclosed any contractual governance or economic terms associated with the NFL’s 10% equity stake in ESPN (for example exclusivity commitments, rights‑pricing formulas, revenue‑share mechanics or veto/special shareholder rights) and if so what specific terms were disclosed and in which documents? A: Short answer: No — as of Aug 6, 2025 Disney and the NFL only released high‑level, non‑binding commercial terms; they did not publicly publish detailed contractual governance or economic mechanics (e.g., exclusivity formulas, rights‑pricing schedules, revenue‑share formulas, veto/special shareholder rights). The public documents (company press releases and news reports) describe the 10% equity exchange, transfer/license of NFL Network/RedZone/Fantasy, and that ESPN platforms will carry three additional games (and shift four games), but say definitive agreements and approvals remain to be negotiated and filed.

[169] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: By Aug 6, 2025, had Disney published any empirical, quantitative evidence showing cross‑platform monetization outcomes (for example ARPU uplift, conversion rates for in‑stream commerce or incremental merch/parks revenue) that were attributable to integrating live‑sports signals with its first‑party identity graph, and if so what metrics and where were they reported? A: Short answer: No — I found no public, authoritative Disney publication (by Aug 6, 2025) that provides an empirical, quantitative causal study tying cross‑platform monetization outcomes (e.g., ARPU uplift, conversion rates for in‑stream commerce, or incremental parks/merch revenue) specifically to “integrating live‑sports signals with its first‑party identity graph.” Disney has published related metrics — ESPN+/ARPU figures in SEC filings and marketing/press pieces claiming stronger ad performance and growth in data‑enabled deals and audience‑graph capabilities — but those documents stop short of publishing a third‑party‑validated, attributional study linking live‑sports signal + identity‑graph integration to the specific cross‑platform monetization lifts you asked about.

A: Short answer: No — as of Aug 6, 2025 Disney/ESPN did not publish a public, territory‑by‑territory rights‑clearance map nor a detailed public list of which international territories required re‑clearance or sublicensing for NFL content to appear immediately on ESPN’s new DTC service or on Disney+/Hulu. Disney/ESPN announcements (Aug 6 release and ESPN DTC materials) describe expanded NFL rights and that select draft and NFL content will stream on ESPN DTC/Disney+/Hulu, but they do not include a territory map or per‑country timelines; industry reporting also noted ongoing entitlement/authentication negotiations.

A: Short answer: No public disclosure found. I located no Disney press release or SEC filing through Aug 6, 2025 announcing or registering long‑dated unsecured debt structured as sustainability‑linked notes (SLL/SLB) tied to streaming or ship‑decarbonization KPIs. Disney’s filings instead show other financing (a $5.25bn 364‑day unsecured credit agreement filed Feb 28, 2025 and cruise‑ship credit facilities / a $1.1bn draw for a ship), but no SLL/SLB sizes, timing or SPT/KPI terms were disclosed.

A: Short answer: Yes — but only limited, high‑level commercial detail. What was announced by Aug 6, 2025: - ESPN/Disney disclosed its new ESPN direct‑to‑consumer plans and pricing (ESPN unlimited $29.99/mo; select $11.99/mo) and said ESPN’s DTC could be bundled with NFL+ Premium (which carries NFL RedZone).

A: Short answer: No. I found no Disney/ESPN public filing, press release or investor material through Aug 6, 2025 that named specific CDN vendors or published contractual capacity commitments or multi‑CDN technical details for the ESPN direct‑to‑consumer launch. ESPN/Disney public announcements describe product, pricing and distribution partners but do not list CDN vendors or contract capacity guarantees.

A: Short answer: No — Disney’s Aug. 6, 2025 announcement described a plan to “fully integrate” Hulu into Disney+ but did not publish low‑level entitlement/billing‑mapping mechanics. Public materials instead gave high‑level rules (how bundles/credits work) rather than detailed provisioning or carrier‑billing mapping logic. (<a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-q3-earnings-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">thewaltdisneycompany.com</a>) Where Disney did document procedures (high level): - Disney+ Bundle terms and Subscriber Agreement — require using the same email to receive a bundle credit, note existing third‑party/ carrier‑billed subscriptions “continue to be billed” by that third party and may receive credits/proration as described. (<a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/disney-bundle-upgrade?utm_source=chatgpt.com">disneyplus.com</a>) - Carrier partner terms (e.g., Verizon/T‑Mobile) explain carrier‑perk handling and that carriers/third parties control billing and activation steps.

A: Short answer: No — by Aug 6, 2025 Disney’s public materials (press releases, earnings remarks and SEC filings) disclosed launch timing and high‑level product/integration plans for ESPN DTC and Hulu→Disney+ but did not describe the specific operational‑readiness items you list (pre‑provisioned redundant encoders, contracted multi‑CDN capacity, ad‑decision fallback paths, 24/7 incident war‑rooms, or published automated rollback playbooks). I reviewed Disney/ESPN press releases and the company’s Q3 FY25 investor/earnings materials and its SEC filings; they announce the ESPN launch date, bundling and app integration but give no public technical runbook or vendor‑capacity disclosures up to Aug 6, 2025.

A: Short answer: No. By Aug 6, 2025 Disney/ESPN and the NFL’s public announcements described expanded NFL content on ESPN’s DTC/Disney+ (RedZone, NFL Network integration, draft and highlight rights, bundling with NFL+ Premium) but did not disclose a country‑by‑country or Southeast‑Asia‑specific rights map nor explicitly state whether SEA rights included full‑game live windows vs. RedZone/highlights/only short‑form.

A: Short answer: No. As of Aug 6, 2025 Disney had not published a customer‑facing, line‑by‑line description of a “staged, opt‑in” Hulu→Disney+ billing migration that spelled out the exact proration math, bundle‑credit formulas, or the operational rules to minimize forced account reassignments. Public filings and the Disney+/Hulu Subscriber Agreement describe general proration, bundle and credit policies and note that terms/implementation may change, but they do not provide the granular migration mechanics or precise credit calculations you describe.

A: Short answer: No. Disney announced on Aug 6, 2025 that it will fully integrate Hulu into Disney+, but I found no public “migration plan” document that discloses quantitative operational migration KPIs (e.g., explicit targets for support‑ticket spikes, billing‑dispute rates, or 90‑day net‑retention). Disney’s Q3 FY25 earnings materials and prepared remarks describe qualitative goals (higher engagement, lower churn, cost/operational synergies) but do not publish numeric migration KPI targets; same absence holds in the related earnings‑call transcript and SEC filings I reviewed.

[179] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of Aug 6, 2025, had Disney announced any creator monetization or revenue‑share programs for short‑form sports highlights, regional creators or talent on ESPN DTC or the unified Disney+/Hulu platform, and if so what revenue‑share percentages, eligibility rules or commercial terms were disclosed and where? A: Short answer: No — as of Aug 6, 2025 Disney/ESPN had not publicly announced any formal revenue‑share percentages, commercial terms or eligibility rules for paying external creators for short‑form sports highlights on the ESPN DTC or the unified Disney+/Hulu app. ESPN runs a Creator Network that provides access, travel and production support (but has not been described as a paid revenue‑share program), and reporting says ESPN plans to host user‑generated/short‑form content on its upcoming DTC service but gave no monetization terms.

[180] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of Aug 6, 2025, which company‑level LNG offtake agreements and which details of the Singapore homeport memorandum of understanding had Disney publicly disclosed in connection with its cruise expansion, and had Disney publicly released any ship‑level lifecycle greenhouse‑gas LCAs or binding shore‑power/fuel contracts for specific ports (for example names, durations or minimum volumes)? A: Short answer (as of Aug 6, 2025): - Company‑level LNG offtake: Disney’s SEC/annual disclosures state Disney entered a long‑term LNG offtake to take a set volume over an initial 10‑year (later revised to 12‑year) term from “one particular supplier,” with a pricing structure — but the filings do not name the supplier or disclose contract volumes, minimums or pricing. (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com">sec.gov</a>) - Singapore homeport MoU: Disney and the Singapore Tourism Board publicly disclosed an MOU to homeport a new Disney ship in Singapore “for at least five years beginning in 2025” (maiden/itinerary details to be announced); media coverage noted the vessel will be green‑methanol‑ready. (<a href="https://www.stb.gov.sg/content/stb/en/media-centre/media-releases/Disney-Cruise-Line-and-Singapore-Tourism-Board-to-Bring-Magical-Cruise-Vacations-to-Southeast-Asia.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">stb.gov.sg</a>, <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/disney-cruise-line-ship-singapore-home-port-3381991?utm_source=chatgpt.com">channelnewsasia.com</a>) - Ship‑level LCAs / binding shore‑power or fuel contracts: I found no public, ship‑level lifecycle GHG LCAs nor Disney disclosures of binding shore‑power or fuel‑supply contracts for specific ports that include named supplier, duration or minimum volumes in its press releases, sustainability pages or SEC filings. (Disney has published vessel efficiency claims and port terminal/berthing agreements separately.)

[181] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: By Aug 6, 2025, had Disney or ESPN formally pre‑notified the European Commission or filed any binding behavioral commitments to address competition concerns tied to ESPN’s proposed acquisition of NFL Network and related assets (for example time‑limited wholesale licensing, audited ad‑inventory non‑discrimination, independent trustee arrangements), and if so what specific commitments and filings were made public and where? A: Short answer: No — as of 6 Aug 2025 there were no public records that Disney/ESPN had formally pre‑notified the European Commission or filed any publicly‑available, binding behavioural commitments relating to ESPN’s proposed purchase of NFL Network. The parties announced a non‑binding agreement on 5 Aug 2025 and said regulatory approvals would be required, but I find no DG Competition merger case, press release or published commitments for this transaction by 6 Aug 2025. (<a href="https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2025/08/espn-to-acquire-nfl-network-and-other-media-assets-from-the-nfl-in-exchange-for-a-10-equity-stake-in-espn/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">espnpressroom.com</a>, <a href="https://competition-policy.ec.europa.eu/mergers/latest-news_en?utm_source=chatgpt.com">competition-policy.ec.europa.eu</a>) Where such filings would appear (to check): the European Commission’s DG Competition merger case‑register / “Mergers” pages and the Official Journal / EUR‑Lex (DG Competition publishes notifications, commitments and decisions there). If you’d like, I can monitor those sources and alert you to any subsequent pre‑notification or published commitments.</p>

[182] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: By Aug 6, 2025, had Disney disclosed the percentage of company revenue attributable to live sports (including ESPN) or published quantitative measures of ad CPM variance or consolidated free‑cash‑flow volatility attributable to live sports, and if so what figures and in which documents were those metrics reported? A: Short answer: Yes — but only as segment dollar amounts (not an explicit “live‑sports %” line) — and No on CPM or quantified FCF‑volatility attribution. What Disney published by Aug 6, 2025 - Fiscal 2024 Form 10‑K: Sports revenue $17,619M of total revenue $91,361M (≈19.3% of company revenue). (See Disney FY2024 10‑K). (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com">sec.gov</a>) - Quarterly earnings/press releases (Q1–Q3 FY2025) report Sports/ESPN revenue and advertising revenue changes (rates/impressions), but do not report ad CPM variance metrics or a quantified amount of consolidated free‑cash‑flow volatility “attributable to” live sports. See Q2 FY2025 release and Q3 FY2025 release (Aug 6, 2025).

[183] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: By Aug 6, 2025, had Disney published any consumer‑survey or household‑level analysis quantifying how a $29.99 Disney+/Hulu/ESPN bundle would change household entertainment spending, pay‑TV substitution or likelihood to reallocate savings to higher‑margin Disney experiences (parks, cruises, merchandise), and if so what were the reported results and sources? A: Short answer: No — I found no public, Disney‑published consumer survey or household‑level analysis (through Aug 6, 2025) that quantifies how a $29.99 Disney+/Hulu/ESPN bundle would change household entertainment spending, pay‑TV substitution, or the likelihood households would reallocate savings to parks/cruises/merchandise. Notes &amp; sources: Disney has published streaming metrics and commentary (e.g., ad‑supported MAU and earnings/retention figures) but not the specific household‑spending reallocation surveys you asked about.

[184] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: By Aug 6, 2025, had Disney published quantitative schedules or projected contributions (timing and expected revenue/ARPU impact) for the monetization levers it cited for the unified bundle strategy—specifically bundle pricing, in‑app commerce, expanded ad inventory, paid tiers (RedZone/NFL+) and MVPD packaging—and if so what figures or timelines were disclosed and in which documents? A: Short answer: No — Disney had not published a consolidated, line‑by‑line quantitative schedule showing timing + expected revenue/ARPU contribution for each unified‑bundle monetization lever by Aug 6, 2025. Instead it disclosed piecemeal facts across press releases, SEC filings and earnings materials: - Bundle pricing: announced U.S. bundle prices (e.g., Disney+/Hulu/Max $16.99 w/ads; $29.99 ad‑free). (<a href="https://press.disneyplus.com/disney-entertainment-and-warner-bros-discovery-announce-disney-plus-hulu-max-bundle?utm_source=chatgpt.com">press.disneyplus.com</a>) - Historical ARPU / ad‑tier uptake and monthly‑ARPU metrics appear in SEC filings/earnings (e.g., domestic Disney+ avg monthly revenue ~$8.06 in 10‑Q / earnings releases; management cited strong ad‑tier mix). (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448925000098/dis-20250329.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com">sec.gov</a>, <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-company-reports-second-quarter-earnings-for-fiscal-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">thewaltdisneycompany.com</a>) - Paid‑tier / sports timing and packaging: ESPN DTC launch timing (Aug 21, 2025) and NFL+/RedZone bundling rights were announced in earnings commentary, but without a per‑lever revenue/ARPU roadmap.

A: As of Aug 6, 2025: Disney had publicly disclosed carrier-billing / telco partnerships in SEA that support lower‑cost/mobile (lightweight) Disney+ / Disney+ Hotstar offers — notable examples and public commercial terms: - Indonesia — Telkomsel: marketed mobile bundles and promo pricing (e.g., offers from ~Rp20,000; baseline Disney+ Hotstar listed Rp39,000/mo). (<a href="https://www.telkomsel.com/en/about-us/news/telkomsel-provides-best-choice-indonesia-enjoy-disney-hotstar?utm_source=chatgpt.com">telkomsel.com</a>) - Thailand — AIS: explicit mobile‑only pricing (e.g., THB99/mo mobile plan; yearly mobile THB799).

[186] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of Aug 6, 2025, had The Walt Disney Company or ESPN publicly disclosed any quantitative estimates or reported results for changes in ARPU, ad RPM, minutes‑per‑user or incremental subscribers attributable to the ESPN direct‑to‑consumer launch or the integration of Hulu into Disney+, and if so what numeric values and sources were published? A: Short answer: No — as of Aug 6, 2025 Disney/ESPN published service-level metrics (ARPU, subscribers, total minutes watched) but did not publish numeric estimates or post‑launch results explicitly attributing changes in ARPU, ad‑RPM, minutes‑per‑user or “incremental subscribers” to (a) the upcoming ESPN direct‑to‑consumer launch or (b) the planned integration of Hulu into Disney+. What they did publish (examples): - Q3 FY25 guidance: “Total Disney+ and Hulu subscriptions: Increase of more than 10 million in Q4, with the majority coming from Hulu (expanded Charter deal).” (<a href="https://licensinginternational.org/news/disney-reports-third-quarter-and-nine-months-earnings-for-fiscal-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">licensinginternational.org</a>) - Service ARPU/subscriber figures (reported, not attributed to the integrations): Disney+ domestic ARPU ≈ $8.06–$8.09; Hulu SVOD ARPU ≈ $12.36–$12.40; ESPN+ ARPU ≈ $6.40 (June 28, 2025 filing).

[187] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of Aug 6, 2025, had Disney published time‑series per‑stream greenhouse‑gas metrics (for example gCO2e per 1,000 viewing‑minutes) or per‑vessel lifecycle GHG assessments tied to its SBTi goals, and had it disclosed any intention or terms to link such KPIs to sustainability‑linked financing (for example SLB or green‑bond covenants); if so, what numeric metrics or commitments were disclosed and where? A: Short answer: No clear public disclosures were found as of Aug 6, 2025. - Disney has SBTi‑validated 2030 targets for Scope 1/2 (46.2% absolute reduction / net‑zero direct ops) and Scope‑3 engagement, but its public Impact/SSI disclosures do not publish time‑series per‑stream GHG metrics (e.g., gCO2e per 1,000 viewing‑minutes). (<a href="https://impact.disney.com/environment/environmental-sustainability/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">impact.disney.com</a>) - Disney Cruise Line publishes vessel‑level operational emissions and an emissions‑intensity metric (metric tons CO2e per passenger‑cruise‑day) in its segment reporting, but I found no public cradle‑to‑grave (life‑cycle) per‑vessel LCA tied explicitly to the SBTi targets.

[197] <strong>SEA Regional Digital Markets Analyst</strong> [Strength] In SEA, Disney can rapidly monetize constrained NFL rights by piloting telco‑distributed micro‑packages (match‑passes/day‑passes), e‑wallet/USSD microbilling and local fantasy/betting integrations—because mobile users favor low‑commitment buys and telco bundles lower CAC, accelerate ARPU and prove unit economics without full‑game rights spend; pilot with one market+OEM preinstall/local commentary.

[204] <strong>Broadcast Operations Director</strong> [Strength] Maintaining parallel linear distribution (ESPN/NFL Network on pay TV) provides a practical operational fallback that can absorb viewership spikes and materially reduce single‑app outage impact because linear carriage can decongest CDN/origin load and preserve live‑viewer experience during app incidents [Status: INCONCLUSIVE].

A: Short answer: No public commitment was published. Disney’s Aug. 6, 2025 earnings materials and related press coverage announced full Hulu integration into Disney+ (unified app planned for 2026) and said it will add features and personalization, but did not publish UI/technical docs, rollout timelines, or press releases that commit to enforced kid‑profile defaults, autoplay/content gating, or mandatory per‑profile PIN gating or give enforcement dates.

[215] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of Aug 6, 2025, had Disney, ESPN or the NFL publicly disclosed any joint co‑marketing pilots or formal marketing agreements that grant ESPN access to league or team assets (for example ticketing databases, stadium Wi‑Fi activations, or team‑channel activations) to support ESPN direct‑to‑consumer acquisition; if so, which pilots or agreements were disclosed and where were they published? A: Short answer: I found no public disclosure, as of Aug 6, 2025, by Disney/ESPN or the NFL of any joint co‑marketing pilots or formal marketing agreements that explicitly grant ESPN access to league‑ or team‑level assets (e.g., ticketing databases, stadium Wi‑Fi activations, or team‑channel activations) to support ESPN’s DTC build. The Aug 5–6, 2025 public releases describe content/licensing deals and ESPN’s planned acquisition/integration of NFL media assets, but they do not state access to team ticketing or stadium Wi‑Fi or team site/channel back‑ends. Notable related public agreements (ticketing and data partnerships) are ESPN’s Vivid Seats ticketing partnership (2022) and a Genius Sports data deal (2024), neither of which publicly disclose the kinds of team/venue asset access you asked about.

A: Short answer: No. In the parties’ public announcement(s) and Disney’s SEC disclosure through Aug. 6, 2025, ESPN/The Walt Disney Company described a non‑binding agreement to acquire NFL Network and said the transaction is subject to customary approvals and regulatory review, but they did not publicly propose or commit to “functional separation” remedies (separate ad‑sales teams, restricted audience‑data access, independent auditor/trustee, etc.) in those releases or the cited filings. I found no public filing or press statement by Disney/ESPN on or before Aug 6, 2025 that disclosed such remedies. (<a href="https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2025/08/espn-to-acquire-nfl-network-and-other-media-assets-from-the-nfl-in-exchange-for-a-10-equity-stake-in-espn/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">espnpressroom.com</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448925000136/dis-20250628.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com">sec.gov</a>) If you want, I can continue searching regulatory filings (DOJ/FTC/FCC or later SEC filings) after Aug 6 for any subsequent proposed remedies.</p>

[241] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: By Aug 6, 2025, had Disney publicly disclosed pre‑launch operational KPIs for the ESPN direct‑to‑consumer service—specifically numeric targets or measurements for multi‑region peak concurrency (streams/sec per region), p99 startup latency, and ad‑stitch error rate—and if so what were the numeric targets and where were they published? A: Short answer: No — I found no public disclosure by Disney/ESPN, before Aug 6, 2025, that published numeric pre‑launch targets for (a) multi‑region peak concurrency in streams/sec per region, (b) p99 startup latency, or (c) ad‑stitch error rate. My search of ESPN/Disney launch press releases, SEC filings and investor materials, tech/engineering posts and media coverage turned up launch pricing, timing and high‑level product statements but not those operational KPI numbers. (<a href="https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2025/05/new-direct-to-consumer-offering-to-be-singularly-branded-espn/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">espnpressroom.com</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com">sec.gov</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/06/espn-streaming-service-launch-date.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">cnbc.com</a>) Note: ESPN’s help docs state an account‑level concurrent‑stream limit (five streams) — which is different from an infrastructure concurrency target — but I found no published SLO/SLO‑style numeric targets for p99 startup or ad‑stitch error rate.

[242] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: By Aug 6, 2025, had Disney publicly committed to a timebound “Migration Welcome Pack” for accounts migrated from Hulu to Disney+ (for example park/cruise/merch credits for households that retain service 90 days); if so, what were the eligibility criteria, credit amounts, and where were those terms disclosed? A: Short answer: No — I found no public commitment by Disney, as of Aug 6, 2025, to a time‑bound “Migration Welcome Pack” (e.g., guaranteed park/cruise/merch credits for households that keep service 90 days). Disney did launch a Disney+ / Hulu Perks program (discounts, sweepstakes, occasional resort/cruise promotions) on May 29, 2025 and announced full Hulu→Disney+ integration on Aug 6, 2025, but neither release or the Hulu/Disney subscriber terms I reviewed disclose a time‑bound migration credit package with 90‑day retention criteria or specified credit amounts.

[243] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: By Aug 6, 2025, had Disney or ESPN publicly committed to short‑term sublicensing or revenue‑share pilot programs with incumbent broadcasters or federations—leveraging the NFL’s reported 10% equity stake—to accelerate international ESPN DTC rollouts; if so, which pilot agreements, territories and commercial terms were disclosed and where? A: Short answer: No. As of Aug 6, 2025 Disney/ESPN’s public announcements (including the ESPN/Disney press release and Disney’s statements about additional NFL licensing and DTC bundling) described the non‑binding NFL‑assets/10%‑stake transaction and distribution/bundling plans, but they did not disclose any short‑term sublicensing or revenue‑share “pilot” programs, territories, or commercial terms tied to accelerating international ESPN DTC rollouts. There were no public press releases or earnings‑call disclosures describing specific pilot agreements or commercial deal terms.

[244] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: By Aug 6, 2025, had Disney published measurable “Inclusion KPIs” for the unified Disney+/Hulu/ESPN application (for example carrier‑billing coverage percentage in top markets; penetration of mobile‑only/low‑bandwidth SKUs; number or percentage of supported locales; retention metrics for low‑income cohorts); if so, what KPI values and sources were disclosed? A: Short answer (as of Aug 6, 2025): partially. Disney publicly disclosed some cross‑platform metrics for the unified offering (notably ad‑supported MAU = 157 million), and that Disney+ is available in “more than 150 countries/territories.” However I found no public Disney disclosure by that date giving measurable “inclusion KPIs” such as carrier‑billing coverage percentages in top markets; penetration rates for mobile‑only or low‑bandwidth SKUs; or retention metrics for low‑income cohorts. (<a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-advertising-shares-ad-supported-monthly-active-users-mau-methodology/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">thewaltdisneycompany.com</a>, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448925000067/dis-20241228.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com">sec.gov</a>) If you want, I can run a deeper document search (earnings calls, investor decks, regional operator agreements) to double‑check for any narrower disclosures.</p>

[245] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: By Aug 6, 2025, had Disney publicly disclosed any changes to talent‑contracting, creator revenue‑share frameworks or union agreements (for example with SAG‑AFTRA or broadcasters) enabling the monetization or digital reuse of talent‑led micro‑shows and short sports clips on ESPN DTC; if so, what contract terms or revenue‑share rates were published and where? A: Short answer: No — I found no Disney press release, investor filing or posted contract (through Aug 6, 2025) that publicly published bespoke talent‑contract or creator revenue‑share rates for monetizing talent‑led micro‑shows or short sports clips specifically on the new ESPN DTC service. Disney did publicly announce ESPN DTC rights deals and the service launch plans, but those releases/SEC filings do not disclose talent/creator revenue‑share terms. Relevant public documents that do disclose industry/union rates that would apply to short‑form/commercial use are the SAG‑AFTRA 2025 Commercials Contracts (e.g., one‑year streaming commercial use now pays $10,000; Paid‑YouTube = +12% over Traditional Digital).

[246] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: By Aug 6, 2025, had Disney publicly announced any regulatory‑contingent securitization or financing structure (for example senior notes backed by stabilized Disney+/Hulu/ESPN subscription and ad cashflows with an escrow/insurance layer for potential regulatory remedies); if so, what were the proposed instrument terms, contemplated size/timing and where were those proposals disclosed? A: Short answer: No — by Aug 6, 2025 Disney had not publicly announced a regulatory‑contingent securitization (e.g., senior notes explicitly backed by stabilized Disney+/Hulu/ESPN subscription &amp; ad cashflows with an escrow/insurance layer for regulatory remedies). Disney’s public disclosures and press releases show conventional corporate borrowings and unsecured note offerings, and its SEC filings discuss Hulu’s appraisal/payment but not any subscription‑cashflow ABS or regulatory‑contingent notes. (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448925000098/dis-20250329.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com">sec.gov</a>, <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-company-announces-commencement-of-senior-unsecured-notes-offering-by-the-walt-disney-company-and-concurrent-tender-offers-by-the-walt-disney-company-and-21st-century-fox-america-inc/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">thewaltdisneycompany.com</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/09/disney-comcast-hulu-valuation.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">cnbc.com</a>) If you want, I can run a deeper targeted search (deal prospectuses, offering memos, or ABS offering files) for any quiet/market‑channel transactions up to Aug 6, 2025.</p>

[247] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: By Aug 6, 2025, had Disney disclosed a revenue‑currency split or scenario analysis showing the percentage of streaming and live‑sports revenues denominated in US dollars versus local currencies and any illustrative FX‑sensitivity scenarios tied to the ESPN/NFL and unified‑bundle strategy; if so, what split or scenarios were published and where? A: Short answer: No — by Aug 6, 2025 Disney had not published an explicit revenue‑currency “split” (percentage of streaming vs. live‑sports revenue denominated in U.S. dollars vs. local currencies) nor an illustrated FX‑sensitivity scenario tied specifically to the ESPN/NFL or unified‑bundle rollout. Disney’s public disclosures instead show domestic vs. international revenue by segment, discuss aggregate FX impacts (e.g., ~1 percentage‑point FX drag on service revenue) and describe its hedging program (notional hedges and AOCI effects). See Disney’s 2024 Form 10‑K and subsequent 2025 interim filing for those disclosures. (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com">sec.gov</a>)</p>

[248] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: By Aug 6, 2025, had Disney publicly announced telco zero‑rating agreements, prepaid retail voucher programs or e‑wallet promotional partnerships in Indonesia, the Philippines or Thailand to support low‑cost subscriber acquisition for ESPN/NFL content; if so, which telco or partner names, which markets and what commercial terms (for example revenue‑share or pricing) were disclosed and where? A: Short answer: No definitive public announcement was found by Aug 6, 2025 that Disney/ESPN named telcos or e‑wallet partners in Indonesia, the Philippines or Thailand specifically to zero‑rate, sell prepaid vouchers, or run e‑wallet promotions aimed at low‑cost subscriber acquisition for ESPN/NFL content. What I checked: Disney/ESPN’s Aug 6, 2025 NFL/ESPN press release and ESPN DTC materials do not disclose regional telco/e‑wallet deals for ESPN/NFL; by contrast Disney has publicly run telco/voucher distribution programs for Disney+ Hotstar in those markets (e.g., Telkomsel in Indonesia, AIS in Thailand, Globe in the Philippines). (<a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/espn-and-the-nfl-reach-new-agreements-to-extend-nfl-draft-rights-and-add-nfl-content-and-features-to-espns-upcoming-direct-to-consumer-service/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">thewaltdisneycompany.com</a>, <a href="https://www.telkomsel.com/en/about-us/news/telkomsel-and-disney-hotstar-unveil-attractive-pricing-and-pre-launch-special-offers?utm_source=chatgpt.com">telkomsel.com</a>, <a href="https://www.globe.com.ph/about-us/newsroom/consumer/disneyplus-free-gfiber-surf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">globe.com.ph</a>) If you want, I can run a deeper targeted search (local-language announcements, telco investor filings, or convenience‑store voucher listings) to try to surface any smaller or partner‑level disclosures.</p>

[249] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: By Aug 6, 2025, had Disney announced or published details of market pilots designed to convert streaming engagement during NFL windows into in‑real‑life commerce (for example commissioning local‑language player vignettes, in‑app watch‑parties, or time‑limited experience vouchers); if so, which pilots and markets were announced and what pilot metrics or outcomes were disclosed? A: Short answer: Partially. Disney publicly announced new commerce formats—“Shop the Stream” (Shopsense storefronts) and a “Virtual Concession Stand” (Gopuff) — and said ESPN’s upcoming DTC app will surface commerce (including NFL merchandise). Those announcements did not, however, include public, market‑level NFL‑window pilots (e.g., commissioned local‑language player vignettes, in‑app watch‑party pilots tied to NFL windows, or time‑limited experience vouchers) nor published pilot metrics/outcomes by Aug 6, 2025. I did not find any Disney/ESPN press release or trade reporting before that date describing those specific pilot programs or publishing outcomes.

[250] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: By Aug 6, 2025, had Disney published ship‑level lifecycle greenhouse‑gas assessments (LCAs), binding shore‑power or fuel‑supply contracts, or decarbonization covenants for the specific vessels or ports in its announced cruise expansion; if so, which ships and ports were covered, what LCA figures or contractual terms (for example durations or minimum volumes) were disclosed and where? A: Short answer: By Aug 6, 2025 Disney had not published public, ship‑level full lifecycle GHG (LCA) studies or publicly posted port‑specific decarbonization covenants. It did publish ship‑level operational GHG/efficiency estimates (e.g., Disney Wish ≈20% lower CO2 vs. a conventional same‑size ship) and disclosed a long‑term LNG offtake arrangement (originally described as a 10‑year, later revised to 12‑year volume commitment) for Florida deliveries. Disney also participates in shore‑power planning/use (e.g., Port Everglades shore‑power master plan; regular shore‑power use in Vancouver) but I found no public, binding shore‑power contracts that specify ships/terminals published by that date.

[251] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: By Aug 6, 2025, had Disney published a territory‑specific list of waivers, transitional sublicenses or other license carve‑outs obtained from leagues or rights holders that enable expedited DTC launches for ESPN or Disney+; if so, which territories were covered, what rights were waived or sublicensed, and in which public documents were those items disclosed? A: Short answer: No consolidated, territory‑by‑territory “waiver / transitional sublicense / license‑carve‑out” list published by Disney was found as of Aug 6, 2025. Instead, Disney/ESPN disclose rights on a deal‑by‑deal basis (SEC filings and company press releases) — e.g., SEC disclosures note sublicensing activity but don’t provide a territory matrix, and individual press releases describe specific deals (NBA/WNBA, NFL Draft, WWE, CFP→TNT sublicenses, etc.) with territory/rights details where relevant. (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com">sec.gov</a>, <a href="https://espnpressroom.com/us/press-releases/2025/05/new-direct-to-consumer-offering-to-be-singularly-branded-espn/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">espnpressroom.com</a>, <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/tnt-sports-college-football-playoff-games-sublicense-espn/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">thewaltdisneycompany.com</a>) If you want, I can (a) compile the individual public disclosures to produce a territory/rights table, or (b) run a targeted search for any later/hidden document you have in mind.</p>

[252] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: By Aug 6, 2025, had Disney publicly described any programs or pilots that convert live‑sports appointment viewing (for example NFL windows) into geo‑targeted, time‑limited park/cruise/merch offers (game‑day promos), and if so which markets, what promo mechanics and what measured conversion or revenue metrics were disclosed? A: Short answer (as of Aug 6, 2025): Yes and no. - Yes — Disney has publicly described commerce‑enabled/live‑sports ad products (Magic Words Live, “Shop the Stream”/Gateway Shop, shoppable QR/“send‑to‑phone” units and a Gopuff “virtual concession” experience) and said ESPN’s upcoming DTC/commerce features will enable in‑stream merch purchases. (<a href="https://press.disneyadvertising.com/disney%27s-magic-words-live-connecting-moods-%26-moments-in-sports?utm_source=chatgpt.com">press.disneyadvertising.com</a>) - No — Disney has not publicly described a named pilot that specifically converts live‑sports appointment viewing into geo‑targeted, time‑limited Disney Parks / Cruise Line ticket or cruise package “game‑day” offers (with stated market rollouts), nor published conversion or revenue metrics for such park/cruise game‑day promos through Aug 6, 2025.

[253] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: By Aug 6, 2025, had Disney offered time‑limited programmatic‑guaranteed wholesale ad slots or an API‑accessible ad‑pod/RedZone wholesale product to MVPDs or third‑party streamers to preserve multi‑party access to live sports; if so, what were the product terms, pricing or contractual commitments and where were they published? A: Short answer: No public record (as of Aug 6, 2025) shows Disney publishing a time‑limited, programmatic‑guaranteed “wholesale ad‑slot” or an API‑accessible ad‑pod/“RedZone” wholesale product made available to MVPDs or third‑party streamers with published product terms, pricing or contract language. Disney did publicly expand programmatic/biddable and programmatic‑guaranteed access for advertisers via DRAX/DRAX Direct and a live‑certification program, but those announcements describe advertiser/DSP integrations (not a published wholesale ad‑pod API or MVPD wholesale product or public contracts). (<a href="https://press.disneyadvertising.com/disney-simplifies-streaming-inventory-access-for-advertisers?utm_source=chatgpt.com">press.disneyadvertising.com</a>, <a href="https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/404923/disney-advertising-expands-global-ad-supported-aut.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">mediapost.com</a>) Note: lack of public documentation is not proof Disney never offered private/partner‑only wholesale deals; I can search trade filings, contract registries, or request deeper vendor/press coverage if you want.</p>

[254] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: By Aug 6, 2025, had Disney published a detailed family‑migration and parental‑controls playbook for the unified Disney+/Hulu/ESPN app (for example auto‑migration to kid profiles, default Kid Mode settings, mandatory per‑profile PINs for purchases, per‑profile device mapping and rollout timelines); if so, what specific technical or timing details and where were they disclosed? A: Short answer: No — by Aug 6, 2025 Disney had not published an authoritative, detailed “family‑migration / parental‑controls playbook” covering items like automatic migration into kid profiles, default Kid‑Mode defaults, mandatory per‑profile purchase PINs, per‑profile device mapping or a full technical rollout schedule. What exists: - Disney’s published parental‑controls guidance (Junior Mode, profile PINs, content‑rating toggles) but it’s a user guide, not a migration/technical playbook. (<a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/explore/articles/parental-controls-guide-disney-plus?utm_source=chatgpt.com">disneyplus.com</a>) - Disney’s Aug 6, 2025 investor/earnings materials announced full Hulu→Disney+ integration and a 2026 unified‑app timeline but gave no granular migration/playbook specs.

[255] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: By Aug 6, 2025, had Disney publicly disclosed the existence and material terms of contingent business‑interruption or technology‑failure insurance policies, named multi‑CDN SLAs, or escrow arrangements intended to transfer execution risk for the ESPN DTC launch and the Hulu→Disney+ migration; if so, what providers, coverage amounts or SLA commitments were disclosed and in which documents? A: Short answer: No authoritative public disclosure of those specific risk‑transfer terms was available by Aug 6, 2025. Disney’s SEC filings discuss insurance and DTC risks in general but do not identify contingent business‑interruption/tech‑failure insurers or coverage amounts, name CDN SLA commitments, or describe escrow arrangements tied to the ESPN DTC or the U.S. Hulu→Disney+ migration. (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com">sec.gov</a>) Context / supporting detail (brief): - Disney’s 10‑K/10‑Qs describe insurance and DTC risks generically but don’t list policy limits, insurer names, SLA metrics or escrow terms.

[256] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: By Aug 6, 2025, had Disney published a policy to preserve existing Hulu subscribers’ billing and entitlements for a defined grace period (for example 12 months) during migration into the unified Disney+ app, including guarantees for carrier‑billing parity and an account rollback mechanism; if so, what were the exact terms, timelines and source documents? A: Short answer: No authoritative Disney policy (as of Aug 6, 2025) promising a defined grace period (e.g., 12 months), explicit carrier‑billing parity, or an “account rollback” mechanism for migrating existing Hulu subscribers was published. What I checked: Disney’s Q3 FY2025 executive commentary (Aug 6, 2025) announcing full Hulu→Disney+ integration, and Disney+/Hulu subscriber agreements (Jan 27, 2025 / updated May 5, 2025) that describe bundle/third‑party billing and existing‑subscriber credit rules but do not spell out a fixed grace period, carrier‑billing parity guarantee, or a rollback procedure. I could not find any Disney press release, help‑center FAQ, or legal term that matches the specific protections you describe.

[257] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of Aug 6, 2025, had Disney announced plans to issue sustainability‑linked debt (for example SLLs/SLBs) tied to ship or streaming KPIs, and had it published cradle‑to‑grave lifecycle assessments (LCAs) and auditable sustainability performance targets (SPTs) supporting those financings; if so, what issuance terms, LCA metrics and SPTs were disclosed and in which documents? A: Short answer: No clear public record that Disney had announced sustainability‑linked debt (SLL/SLB) tied to cruise‑ship or streaming KPIs as of Aug 6, 2025 — Disney’s public debt filings/press releases show conventional notes/credit facilities, and I found no SLB/SLL term‑sheets referencing ship or streaming KPIs. Disney has published 2030 environmental goals (SBTi‑validated Scope 1&amp;2 targets, net‑zero for direct operations) and says it will use LCAs to evaluate materials, but it has not published cradle‑to‑grave LCAs or discrete, auditable SPTs framed as financing KPIs in public offering/loan documents. Sources: Disney Impact (Environmental Goals / ESG Reporting) and Disney SEC filings/notes offering; Disney 2030 White Paper (LCA reference).

[258] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: By Aug 6, 2025, had Disney or any public research published a Household Subscription Burden index (monthly streaming spend divided by after‑tax household income) segmented by income cohort to assess subscription‑fatigue risks, and if so what index values or cohort breakdowns were reported and where? A: Short answer: No — I found no public Disney publication or widely‑cited public research that, by Aug 6, 2025, published a formal “Household Subscription Burden” index defined as (monthly streaming spend ÷ after‑tax household income) segmented by income cohorts. Disney’s public filings and earnings releases report subscribers, ARPU and monthly revenue but not that ratio. (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com">sec.gov</a>, <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-company-reports-second-quarter-earnings-for-fiscal-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">thewaltdisneycompany.com</a>) What exists instead: industry and academic reports that give monthly streaming spend or subscription counts by income cohort (e.g., Statista, Bank of America, Pew) but they do not publish the precise burden‑index you described. If you want, I can compute that index for U.S. income cohorts using those sources (or search paywalled/academic literature for any niche paper that may have done this).
