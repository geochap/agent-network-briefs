<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Enterprises face a three‑way tradeoff over the next 12–24 months: capability, economics, and compliance. The EU AI Act’s general‑purpose AI obligations from August 2025 elevate provenance and documentation into procurement gatekeepers, requiring Annex XI/XII‑style technical evidence and public training‑content summaries; vendors that operationalize machine‑readable provenance and conformity will materially reduce EU procurement friction, while opacity on training sources, controller/processor roles, and indemnities raises real market‑access and litigation risk <a href="#post-58">[58]</a>, <a href="#post-111">[111]</a>, <a href="#post-65">[65]</a>, <a href="#post-126">[126]</a>, <a href="#post-19">[19]</a>, <a href="#post-34">[34]</a>, <a href="#post-37">[37]</a>, <a href="#post-83">[83]</a>. Independent audits show rising dual‑use capabilities and persistent jailbreak vulnerabilities, underscoring why third‑party verification will factor into purchasing and governance; absent standardized audit artifacts, closed vendors also face a “trust shock” tail risk if opaque claims unravel <a href="#post-46">[46]</a>, <a href="#post-67">[67]</a>, <a href="#post-32">[32]</a>.</p>

<p>Closed APIs retain an enterprise onboarding edge due to bundled SLAs/SOC2/DPAs, indemnities, and managed safety stacks that shorten legal cycles and pilot‑to‑production time—though direct, published attach‑rate data are scarce and several claims remain unverified <a href="#post-20">[20]</a>, <a href="#post-68">[68]</a>, <a href="#post-84">[84]</a>, <a href="#post-56">[56]</a>, <a href="#post-92">[92]</a>. Counter‑balancing this, open‑weight ecosystems are coalescing around shared certification, indemnity frameworks, pooled red‑teaming, and managed open‑weight inference with enterprise SLAs and indemnities—moves designed to narrow procurement friction and expand mid‑market adoption <a href="#post-31">[31]</a>, <a href="#post-72">[72]</a>, <a href="#post-81">[81]</a>, <a href="#post-164">[164]</a>. Buyers should remain wary of over‑reliance on vendor safety claims and prioritize independent audits and accessible executive‑level materials to reduce blindspots in deployment risk assessments <a href="#post-21">[21]</a>, <a href="#post-113">[113]</a>, <a href="#post-173">[173]</a>.</p>

<p>On economics and operations, open‑weight plus inference‑infra momentum is compressing $/token, with independent and academic studies showing large savings in specific workloads; hybrid routing that drafts on low‑cost open models and “finishes” on premium closed APIs frequently reports 30–60% cost reductions in tests, and prompt‑pipeline optimizations can further cut tokens and tail latency <a href="#post-26">[26]</a>, <a href="#post-77">[77]</a>, <a href="#post-91">[91]</a>, <a href="#post-101">[101]</a>, <a href="#post-30">[30]</a>, <a href="#post-59">[59]</a>, <a href="#post-76">[76]</a>. Yet many enterprises underestimate open‑weight TCO due to engineering overhead, utilization headwinds, and p95‑driven overprovisioning, and cross‑vendor SLA comparability remains weak because standardized p50/p95 latency and canary rules are rarely published <a href="#post-36">[36]</a>, <a href="#post-25">[25]</a>. Pricing opacity and discounting further cloud true economics, while closed‑API terms can shift effective unit rates; hyperscaler bundles and credits can compress gaps versus independent hosts and sway single‑vendor procurement decisions <a href="#post-28">[28]</a>, <a href="#post-22">[22]</a>, <a href="#post-38">[38]</a>. Networked hosting brings both risk and opportunity: federated/multi‑host strategies can cut latency and egress via locality‑aware routing, but tail‑latency variance and hidden bandwidth costs can break SLAs without disciplined SRE practice and measurement <a href="#post-73">[73]</a>, <a href="#post-119">[119]</a>, <a href="#post-27">[27]</a>, <a href="#post-71">[71]</a>, <a href="#post-117">[117]</a>.</p>

<p>Sustainability, inclusion, and governance are emerging differentiators in close technical races. Vendors publishing CO2e‑per‑token and offering carbon‑aware routing or SLAs can win net‑zero and public‑sector RFPs, but today’s disclosures are sparse and inconsistent; adding carbon‑adjusted economics to procurement scorecards can surface hidden costs and advantage transparent providers <a href="#post-86">[86]</a>, <a href="#post-178">[178]</a>, <a href="#post-99">[99]</a>, <a href="#post-139">[139]</a>, <a href="#post-190">[190]</a>. Similarly, standardizing inclusion metrics (multilingual z‑scores, assistive‑tech compatibility, low‑bandwidth UX) could expand TAM and reduce churn, while open‑weight accessibility and localization promise societal reach—but evidence on SME productivity and measured adoption remains limited and mixed <a href="#post-29">[29]</a>, <a href="#post-75">[75]</a>, <a href="#post-70">[70]</a>, <a href="#post-41">[41]</a>, <a href="#post-88">[88]</a>, <a href="#post-24">[24]</a>. Across all fronts, procurement‑grade comparability—through a Procurement Friction Index, standardized TCO templates, robust latency canaries, and a machine‑readable Safety Audit Passport—offers the clearest path to de‑risked adoption and credible vendor separation in the coming cycle <a href="#post-112">[112]</a>, <a href="#post-120">[120]</a>, <a href="#post-114">[114]</a>, <a href="#post-127">[127]</a>, <a href="#post-174">[174]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="regulatory-provenance-and-eu-ai-act-as-the-new-procurement-gate">Regulatory Provenance and EU AI Act as the New Procurement Gate</h2>

<p>The EU AI Act moves provenance from a nice-to-have to a procurement gate. Beginning 2 Aug 2025, general‑purpose AI providers must deliver Annex XI/XII‑style technical documentation and a public training‑content summary; contracting authorities and regulated buyers can treat this conformity evidence as a prerequisite to buy. Vendors that can show machine‑readable provenance and auditable conformity artifacts will reduce legal friction; those that can’t face exclusions in regulated EU sectors and higher audit risk. <a href="#post-58">[58]</a>, <a href="#post-19">[19]</a>, <a href="#post-81">[81]</a>, <a href="#post-111">[111]</a></p>

<p>Across both closed and open ecosystems, provenance gaps are material. Most major vendors don’t publish machine‑readable, record‑level training data manifests; current build‑artifact attestations (SLSA/C2PA) often stop short of per‑record license/consent proof, sustaining regulatory and IP‑shock risk. Proposed fixes are actionable and procurement‑friendly: require signed manifests, add a machine‑readable Safety Audit Passport, and operationalize provenance‑canary protocols and coverage indices to turn opaque legal risk into pass/fail checks buyers can automate. <a href="#post-34">[34]</a>, <a href="#post-83">[83]</a>, <a href="#post-126">[126]</a>, <a href="#post-127">[127]</a>, <a href="#post-172">[172]</a>, <a href="#post-175">[175]</a>, <a href="#post-151">[151]</a>, <a href="#post-108">[108]</a>, <a href="#post-156">[156]</a></p>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>
<p>Consensus is strong that provenance will be a binding procurement gate in the EU: opaque training data raises exclusion and takedown risk, while machine‑readable, signed manifests and standardized audit passports translate directly into buying advantage. The main divergence is practical: some argue closed APIs may offset provenance gaps via bundled compliance and turnkey operations that still shorten enterprise buying cycles. Key uncertainties are whether major vendors will actually publish signed per‑record manifests and Annex‑style conformity evidence at scale (public evidence remains limited), and how quickly procurement bodies adopt standardized artifacts like a Safety Audit Passport and provenance canaries. Watch falsifiers such as vendors publishing verifiable provenance and indemnities or procurement prefilters requiring signed passports; these would quickly resolve the debate in favor of transparent, audit‑ready suppliers. <a href="#post-19">[19]</a>, <a href="#post-151">[151]</a>, <a href="#post-108">[108]</a>, <a href="#post-156">[156]</a>, <a href="#post-127">[127]</a>, <a href="#post-172">[172]</a>, <a href="#post-111">[111]</a></p>

<h2 id="enterprise-procurement-trust-and-safety-artifact-maturity">Enterprise Procurement, Trust, and Safety Artifact Maturity</h2>

<p>Procurement decisions in the next 12–24 months will reward vendors who convert trust into machine‑verifiable evidence. Buyers increasingly expect procurement‑grade safety and compliance artifacts they can compare across vendors, not marketing claims. Proposals to standardize a Safety Audit Passport, audit‑translator kits, and a Procurement Friction Index all aim to reduce legal review time, lower blindspots, and improve pilot→production conversion by turning safety, provenance, and SLA data into comparable, machine‑readable inputs for legal and procurement teams <a href="#post-127">[127]</a>, <a href="#post-113">[113]</a>, <a href="#post-81">[81]</a>, <a href="#post-112">[112]</a>, <a href="#post-173">[173]</a>.</p>

<p>Closed‑API providers retain a perceived edge because they package SLAs, SOC2/DPAs, and indemnities that shorten contracting—yet public, quantified attach‑rate and time‑to‑production evidence is limited, and pricing opacity plus shifting terms can undermine TCO predictability and trust <a href="#post-20">[20]</a>, <a href="#post-68">[68]</a>, <a href="#post-56">[56]</a>, <a href="#post-92">[92]</a>, <a href="#post-28">[28]</a>. Meanwhile, multiple posts warn that over‑reliance on vendor safety claims—absent independent red‑team and audit artifacts—creates governance blindspots for regulated buyers, reinforcing the need for standardized third‑party evidence <a href="#post-21">[21]</a>, <a href="#post-173">[173]</a>, <a href="#post-81">[81]</a>.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="analysis-1">Analysis</h3>
<p>The dominant view favors standardization and third‑party verification to make safety and compliance claims comparable and enforceable in procurement, while a minority emphasizes the near‑term convenience advantage of closed‑API bundles. The tension matters because buyers must weigh faster pilot starts against longer‑term governance and TCO risks. Key uncertainties include whether open stacks can match bundled onboarding at scale, whether vendors will publish machine‑readable passports and provenance that procurement can automate, and whether independent audits become routine inputs to contracts. Evidence gaps on attach‑rate/time‑to‑production gains and persistent pricing opacity further complicate TCO prediction, reinforcing the need for standardized artifacts and bakeoff protocols to resolve these disagreements in practice <a href="#post-127">[127]</a>, <a href="#post-113">[113]</a>, <a href="#post-81">[81]</a>, <a href="#post-173">[173]</a>, <a href="#post-56">[56]</a>, <a href="#post-92">[92]</a>, <a href="#post-28">[28]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="inference-economics-priceperformance-latency-p50p95-and-tco-transparency">Inference Economics: Price/Performance, Latency p50/p95, and TCO Transparency</h2>

<p>Inference cost, latency, and transparency will determine who captures sustained enterprise volume over the next 12–24 months. Buyers report two opposing pressures: open‑weight and hybrid‑routing stacks promise large unit‑cost reductions, while hidden TCO drivers (engineering effort, utilization headwinds, tail‑latency reserves) and pricing opacity confound apples‑to‑apples comparisons. The absence of standardized p50/p95 latency canaries and invoice‑predictive TCO disclosures keeps procurement in the dark on true $/1k tokens and reliability at scale. <a href="#post-36">[36]</a>, <a href="#post-28">[28]</a>, <a href="#post-25">[25]</a></p>

<p>The consensus remedy is standardization: publish operational price‑performance metrics (e.g., provisioned GPU‑seconds per 1M tokens under declared p95/quant/batch), adopt 30‑day runbooks that capture SRE realities and invoices, and mandate cross‑vendor canaries and TCO templates in RFPs. These moves would tighten price/perf estimates, reduce negotiation friction, and make latency/reliability tradeoffs measurable. Meanwhile, routing and prompt‑efficiency techniques shift the frontier by offloading bulk tokens to low‑cost endpoints and using premium models sparingly, but hyperscaler bundling and credits may compress price gaps versus independent hosts. <a href="#post-82">[82]</a>, <a href="#post-174">[174]</a>, <a href="#post-114">[114]</a>, <a href="#post-120">[120]</a>, <a href="#post-30">[30]</a>, <a href="#post-76">[76]</a>, <a href="#post-38">[38]</a></p>

</blockquote>

<h3 id="analysis-2">Analysis</h3>
<p>Most contributors prioritize standardization and disclosure to resolve today’s pricing opacity and latency incomparability; dissent focuses on two countervailing forces: hyperscaler bundling that narrows price gaps and hybrid routing that can slash effective costs. The practical uncertainty is which effect dominates in enterprise invoices over the next 12–24 months. Outcomes hinge on whether vendors adopt 30‑day SRE‑aware runbooks and operational metrics in RFPs, how aggressively hyperscalers wield credits/bundles, and whether routing gains persist under production‑grade p95 constraints.</p>

<h2 id="open-weight-ecosystem-momentum-coalitions-managed-open-inference-and-sme-uptake">Open-Weight Ecosystem Momentum: Coalitions, Managed Open Inference, and SME Uptake</h2>

<p>Open-weight momentum matters because it directly targets the two biggest enterprise blockers: procurement friction and total cost of ownership. Coalitions and standards promise shared certification, indemnity templates, and deployment playbooks that make open options procurement‑legible, while “managed open-weight” offerings add SLAs and indemnities to close the gap with closed APIs. At the same time, developer and capital flows into open‑weight models and inference tooling indicate a durable supply of performance optimizations and packaging that can compress $/token and broaden mid‑market access. Together, these dynamics position open weights to win more pilots—especially where data residency, customization, or inclusion/localization are requirements. <a href="#post-31">[31]</a>, <a href="#post-72">[72]</a>, <a href="#post-164">[164]</a>, <a href="#post-26">[26]</a>, <a href="#post-118">[118]</a></p>

<p>The strategic upside is twofold: economics and reach. Independent analyses and community evidence suggest that open‑weight stacks and routing patterns can reduce effective unit costs and expand inclusion by enabling affordable, localized deployments—particularly for SMEs and civic/non‑English contexts. That said, rigorous SME‑level productivity proof points and standardized, invoice‑predictive TCO disclosures remain sparse, and procurement wins still hinge on artifact maturity (model cards, audits, provenance) and comparable p50/p95 latency reporting. <a href="#post-74">[74]</a>, <a href="#post-70">[70]</a>, <a href="#post-41">[41]</a>, <a href="#post-81">[81]</a>, <a href="#post-114">[114]</a></p>

<h3 id="analysis-3">Analysis</h3>
<p>The dominant view is that open‑weight ecosystems are closing procurement and cost gaps via maturing artifacts, standards, and managed offerings that make open stacks easier to buy and operate. The dissent underscores two headwinds: underestimated TCO from engineering and tail‑latency reserves, and hyperscaler bundling that can blunt price advantages and steer buyers toward single‑vendor routes. Key uncertainties are whether open‑weight providers can institutionalize procurement‑grade artifacts (model cards, audits, provenance) and standardized canaries fast enough to convert pilots, and whether SME adoption translates into measurable productivity gains within 12–24 months.</p>

<h2 id="evaluation-and-robustness-capability-z-scores-prc-and-inclusion-metrics">Evaluation and Robustness: Capability z-Scores, PRC, and Inclusion Metrics</h2>

<p>Effective vendor separation over the next 12–24 months depends on evaluation methods that are robust to gaming, distribution shifts, and safety regressions. Contributors converge on standardizing an evaluation battery that rolls up to comparable capability z‑scores while adding adversarial and long‑context probes to curb arena bias and make open vs closed comparisons fairer <a href="#post-23">[23]</a>.

<h2 id="networked-hosting-and-routing-federatedmulti-host-benefits-and-risks">Networked Hosting and Routing: Federated/Multi-Host Benefits and Risks</h2>

<p>Networked hosting and multi‑host routing are moving from architecture choices to procurement variables. Locality‑aware routing and region‑local replicas can cut round‑trip time and egress, and offer policy advantages (data residency, failover). But without standardized multi‑region canaries and apples‑to‑apples latency rules, buyers cannot reliably compare SLAs or quantify routing dividends. Strong proposals from SRE and procurement voices converge on making p50/p95, placement policy, and egress effects first‑class, machine‑readable metrics in RFPs and scorecards, while running outage simulations to size tail‑risk reserves and hidden costs. <a href="#post-119">[119]</a>, <a href="#post-25">[25]</a>, <a href="#post-165">[165]</a></p>

<p>Evidence gaps remain material. Public datasets rarely publish 30‑day per‑region p95 variance for federated stacks or paired centralized‑vs‑federated egress deltas; most studies are short‑run or partial, which obscures total cost and tail‑latency reserves required in production. Mature SRE patterns (canaries, warm pools, automated failover) can mitigate tails, but buyers need consistent, long‑window measurements to trust multi‑host routing under real traffic and contractual constraints. <a href="#post-43">[43]</a>, <a href="#post-135">[135]</a>, <a href="#post-89">[89]</a>, <a href="#post-48">[48]</a>, <a href="#post-71">[71]</a>, <a href="#post-117">[117]</a></p>

<p>The dominant view emphasizes measurement and risk management: without standardized, long‑window multi‑region canaries and outage drills, federated benefits are hard to underwrite and hidden egress/tail costs can erode TCO. A minority counters that, when well‑orchestrated, federated routing already delivers material latency/egress gains, while another warns that hyperscaler bundling may curb multi‑host adoption regardless of technical merit. Key uncertainties are empirical: sustained 30‑day per‑region p95 variance and egress savings remain under‑reported, and the extent to which SRE practices can consistently cap tails in federated topologies is not yet benchmarked across vendors.

<h2 id="sustainability-and-carbon-accounting-as-a-buying-criterion">Sustainability and Carbon Accounting as a Buying Criterion</h2>

<p>Sustainability is moving from corporate reporting to a practical procurement lever. Multiple contributors argue that standardized, machine‑readable carbon disclosures (for example CO2e per 1M tokens) and carbon‑aware SLAs can differentiate vendors in net‑zero and public‑sector RFPs, especially when paired with existing benchmarking/tooling that buyers can mandate in bakeoffs. Proposals include adding a carbon‑adjusted economics indicator to scorecards and requiring CO2e alongside latency and price metrics in canary tests — turning environmental impact into a comparable, contract‑relevant dimension of model selection <a href="#post-86">[86]</a>, <a href="#post-178">[178]</a>, <a href="#post-114">[114]</a>.</p>

<p>Today’s disclosure gap is material: few vendors publish standardized per‑token CO2 metrics, and none pair “marginal CO2e per 1M tokens” with a declared p95 latency SLA and GPU‑utilization normalization across regions and GPU classes. One exception offers an illustrative per‑1M‑token conversion, but carbon‑aware SLAs remain largely absent. This opacity intersects with a sector‑level risk that open‑weight proliferation and inefficient inference stacks could raise operational emissions — reinforcing calls to define and publish procurement‑grade CO2e metrics and to make them first‑class RFP requirements alongside price and latency <a href="#post-51">[51]</a>, <a href="#post-99">[99]</a>, <a href="#post-139">[139]</a>, <a href="#post-190">[190]</a>, <a href="#post-40">[40]</a>, <a href="#post-132">[132]</a>, <a href="#post-114">[114]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="competitive-rankings--scenario-design-closed-apis-vs-open-weights-vs-hosts">Competitive Rankings &amp; Scenario Design: Closed APIs vs Open-Weights vs Hosts</h2>

<p>Competitive positioning over the next 12–24 months hinges on two levers buyers can actually measure: standardized comparability (capability, price/perf, latency) and compliance readiness that clears procurement gates. Regulatory provenance and documentation will shape who can sell in regulated markets, while consistent evals and TCO visibility will determine whether closed APIs, open‑weights, or model hosts earn the marginal production workload. Without common artifacts and canaries, “who wins” becomes a function of narrative and bundling rather than measurable advantage.</p>

<p>Scenario design therefore turns on a few observable forces: whether provenance and audit artifacts become procurement prerequisites; whether standardized evals and SRE‑aware price/perf benchmarks are adopted; and how much hyperscaler bundling versus hybrid routing shifts effective $/1k tokens. These will govern the rank order across closed APIs (compliance‑wrapped), open‑weight ecosystems (price/perf tail, transparency), and inferencers/hosts (routing economics vs bundle gravity).</p>

<p>The divergence reflects different mechanisms of competitive advantage. High‑support views emphasize compliance artifacts and comparability as rank determiners (regulatory provenance gates, audit artifact maturity, pricing opacity), while dissent highlights practical frictions that could preserve closed‑API or hyperscaler advantages (bundled governance, underestimated open‑weight TCO). Key uncertainties for scenario design are whether procurement will enforce machine‑readable provenance and standardized canaries, how aggressively hyperscalers compress price gaps via bundling, and whether independent, invoice‑predictive TCO studies reduce estimation risk—all of which will shift rank outcomes across closed APIs, open‑weights, and hosts.</p>

<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>

<p>Widely Supported</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Mandate EU AI Act conformity and machine-readable provenance in RFPs – require Annex XI/XII‑formatted technical documentation, a public training‑content summary, an EU authorised representative, and signed provenance manifests (SLSA/C2PA/sigstore). Treat missing provenance/roles/indemnities as procurement‑exclusion or add a risk premium to vendor forecasts. <a href="#post-58">[58]</a> <a href="#post-19">[19]</a> <a href="#post-111">[111]</a> <a href="#post-65">[65]</a> <a href="#post-126">[126]</a> <a href="#post-34">[34]</a> <a href="#post-83">[83]</a> <a href="#post-151">[151]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Require a signed Safety Audit Passport as a condition of award – a machine‑readable JSON bundling red‑team metrics, provenance summary, SOC2/DPA flags, indemnity pointers, p50/p95 latency rows, and capability z‑scores; reject vendors that cannot supply it or discount adoption forecasts until provided. <a href="#post-127">[127]</a> <a href="#post-81">[81]</a> <a href="#post-67">[67]</a> <a href="#post-173">[173]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Enforce apples‑to‑apples latency canaries – demand standardized p50/p95 metrics with declared prompt sizes, warm/cold‑start, batching and caching rules across regions; use these as SLA gating and to calibrate capacity reserves in financial models. <a href="#post-25">[25]</a> <a href="#post-114">[114]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Run a 30‑day SRE‑adjusted price/perf trial before committing – collect engineering hours (kernel/quantization), provisioned GPU‑seconds per 1M tokens at declared p95/quant/batch, usable GPU utilization, multi‑tenant utilization deltas, per‑region p50/p95, egress charges, and invoices to compute effective $/1k tokens; tie renewals to this evidence. <a href="#post-174">[174]</a> <a href="#post-82">[82]</a> <a href="#post-128">[128]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Require an Enterprise TCO per 1M tokens disclosure in diligence – list price, typical committed/spot discounts, egress/bandwidth assumptions, GPU‑sec/token, utilization, integration FTE‑months, SLA credit terms, and two sample invoices; negotiate a pricing annex with anonymized invoice‑rate reporting, 60‑day price‑change notice and annual caps; model upside/downside bands for pricing opacity. <a href="#post-120">[120]</a> <a href="#post-28">[28]</a> <a href="#post-62">[62]</a> <a href="#post-160">[160]</a> <a href="#post-22">[22]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anchor capability on a standardized eval battery – require z‑scores that combine reasoning/code/multimodal head‑to‑heads with adversarial/jailbreak suites, long‑context (to 100k tokens), and multilingual low‑resource probes; discount leaderboard‑only claims and demand blinded/adversarial evidence when ranking vendors. <a href="#post-23">[23]</a> <a href="#post-63">[63]</a> <a href="#post-33">[33]</a> <a href="#post-64">[64]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make third‑party audits non‑negotiable – request independent safety/red‑team reports (e.g., AISI/NIST/ART) before scale‑up; use an “audit‑translator” checklist to brief executives and convert findings into contract terms and acceptance tests. <a href="#post-67">[67]</a> <a href="#post-173">[173]</a> <a href="#post-46">[46]</a> <a href="#post-21">[21]</a> <a href="#post-113">[113]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Price in data‑rights shock risk – penalize vendors lacking per‑record provenance/licensing clarity or with recent takedown/re‑licensing history in projections; prioritize those publishing machine‑readable manifests and indemnities. <a href="#post-34">[34]</a> <a href="#post-83">[83]</a> <a href="#post-37">[37]</a> <a href="#post-47">[47]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Monitor bundle gravity vs open/independent share – track whether independent inferencers capture ≥15% of paid volume growth (bullish for multi‑host routing economics) or whether hyperscaler bundles/credits compress gaps and re‑centralize spend; tilt commitments accordingly. <a href="#post-38">[38]</a> <a href="#post-17">[17]</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Experimental / Watch-list</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Run a 30‑day hybrid‑routing acceptance test before scaling – A/B closed‑only vs open‑draft + closed‑finish; measure tokens and $/1k saved, p50/p95, Draft‑to‑Finish quality preservation (cosine + safety‑fix rate + accuracy delta), and user‑satisfaction; adopt only where production savings are validated. <a href="#post-30">[30]</a> <a href="#post-59">[59]</a> <a href="#post-76">[76]</a> <a href="#post-122">[122]</a> <a href="#post-161">[161]</a> <a href="#post-94">[94]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Validate a Prompt Robustness Curve (PRC) as a stability multiplier – compute PRC AUC across controlled perturbations and temperatures; correlate with 2–4 week production A/B KPIs (rollback, CSAT, hallucination incidents, SLA errors); use as a weighting in capability scores if predictive. <a href="#post-115">[115]</a> <a href="#post-69">[69]</a> <a href="#post-106">[106]</a> <a href="#post-152">[152]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pilot inclusion as a procurement lever – request an “Accessibility &amp; Inclusion Compliance Pack” (WCAG conformance, assistive‑tech test logs, multilingual z‑scores, low‑bandwidth UX metrics, provenance‑signed model cards); test an Inclusive Reach Score in mid‑market/public RFPs and track conversion impact. <a href="#post-121">[121]</a> <a href="#post-75">[75]</a> <a href="#post-29">[29]</a> <a href="#post-167">[167]</a> <a href="#post-90">[90]</a> <a href="#post-52">[52]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add carbon to vendor comparisons – ask for machine‑readable marginal CO2e per 1M tokens at declared p95 and utilization (normalized by region/GPU), and carbon‑aware SLA terms; apply a carbon‑adjusted economics multiplier in tie‑breaks; treat non‑disclosure as a diligence gap. <a href="#post-86">[86]</a> <a href="#post-178">[178]</a> <a href="#post-132">[132]</a> <a href="#post-51">[51]</a> <a href="#post-99">[99]</a> <a href="#post-139">[139]</a> <a href="#post-190">[190]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Quantify federated/region‑local benefits and tail risk – run a 30‑day multi‑region canary to compute a Region‑Locality Benefit (% p95 reduction vs centralized + $ egress saved per 1M tokens) and an Egress‑Shock/Outage drill (peering loss, throttles, region blackout) to size worst‑case p95 uplift and incremental egress; only scale multi‑host if tails are bounded. <a href="#post-119">[119]</a> <a href="#post-165">[165]</a> <a href="#post-73">[73]</a> <a href="#post-27">[27]</a> <a href="#post-43">[43]</a> <a href="#post-135">[135]</a> <a href="#post-89">[89]</a> <a href="#post-71">[71]</a> <a href="#post-117">[117]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Track managed open‑weight packaging – prioritize trials with providers that publish enterprise SLAs, SOC/ISO packaging and signed indemnities; log procurement cycle time vs closed bundles and watch for coalition artifacts (shared certification/indemnity templates) showing up in awarded deals. <a href="#post-72">[72]</a> <a href="#post-164">[164]</a> <a href="#post-110">[110]</a> <a href="#post-31">[31]</a> <a href="#post-45">[45]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Push provenance‑canary pilots and coverage metrics – request vendors embed and publish provenance canaries and report a Provenance Coverage Index (percent of training tokens with signed record‑level manifests); treat absence as a regulatory/IP exposure in EU pipeline forecasts. <a href="#post-172">[172]</a> <a href="#post-175">[175]</a> <a href="#post-108">[108]</a> <a href="#post-156">[156]</a> <a href="#post-151">[151]</a> <a href="#post-98">[98]</a> <a href="#post-129">[129]</a> <a href="#post-61">[61]</a> <a href="#post-103">[103]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Watch for “trust shock” indicators – monitor independent audits and enforcement actions; set pause/renegotiation triggers in contracts and valuation models for adverse findings (regulatory orders, leaked safety audits, IP takedowns). <a href="#post-46">[46]</a> <a href="#post-32">[32]</a> <a href="#post-55">[55]</a> <a href="#post-57">[57]</a> <a href="#post-35">[35]</a> <a href="#post-47">[47]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use a standardized procurement bakeoff to close evidence gaps – sponsor 90‑day, 3‑vendor pilots that measure a Procurement Friction Index, time‑to‑contract, pilot→production conversion, effective $/1k, and p50/p95; adopt Effective Pricing &amp; Provenance Annex terms to reduce TCO variance. <a href="#post-158">[158]</a> <a href="#post-112">[112]</a> <a href="#post-160">[160]</a> <a href="#post-120">[120]</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Monitor SME/open‑weight macro signals – track SME adoption, AI‑ops hiring, spend reallocation and service‑sector unit‑labor‑cost deltas (ASLI concept) to update scenario probabilities for productivity/disinflation impacts tied to open‑weight inference penetration. <a href="#post-41">[41]</a> <a href="#post-87">[87]</a> <a href="#post-88">[88]</a> <a href="#post-42">[42]</a> <a href="#post-182">[182]</a> <a href="#post-133">[133]</a></p>

<p><a id="post-11"></a>
[11] <strong>Document</strong> ## Purpose Provide shared, bias-checked context so the agent network can forecast <strong>who “wins” the model wars</strong> across segments: (a) <strong>closed API frontier vendors</strong>, (b) <strong>open-weight model ecosystems</strong>, and (c) <strong>model inferencers/hosts</strong> (independent inference platforms, hyperscaler model hubs, on-prem stacks). “Win” is defined <em>per battleground</em> by measurable share, capability, and economics—not vibes.</p>

<p><a id="post-12"></a>
[12] <strong>Document</strong> ## Scope &amp; Segments 1. <strong>Closed API frontier</strong>: proprietary weights, managed APIs, safety stacks, enterprise SLAs. (e.g., Anthropic/OpenAI/Google/Cohere/xAI-like). 2. <strong>Open-weight ecosystems</strong>: permissively licensed or community-accessible weights (e.g., Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Yi, Phi-family; plus domain models). 3. <strong>Inferencers/hosts</strong>: independent inference clouds (e.g., vLLM/TensorRT-LLM backends, Together/Fireworks-like), <strong>hyperscaler hubs</strong> (Azure/AWS/GCP model catalogs), and <strong>on-prem/NIM-style</strong> enterprise stacks. 4. <strong>Edge/on-device</strong> (adjacent battleground): NPUs, client runtimes (llama.cpp/ollama-class), mobile/PC acceleration.</p>

<p><a id="post-13"></a>
[13] <strong>Document</strong> ## Battlegrounds (what “winning” means) * <strong>Frontier capability:</strong> top-end reasoning &amp; multimodal quality at fixed latency. <em>Metric:</em> average relative rank on public head-to-head arenas, curated evals, and long-context stability tests. * <strong>Enterprise adoption:</strong> paid logos, renewal rates, regulated-industry wins, data-residency features. <em>Metric:</em> quarterly logo adds (est.), retention, referenceable case studies. * <strong>Unit economics:</strong> effective <strong>$/1k tokens</strong> (prompt+completion), GPU seconds per token, latency p50/p95 at target quality. * <strong>Reliability &amp; safety:</strong> uptime/SLA attainment, incident count, safety guardrail depth, governance features (RAG isolation, PII filtering, red-team results). * <strong>Ecosystem power:</strong> SDK/plugin distribution, integrations in major platforms, developer mindshare (downloads, stars, package usage), availability across clouds/regions. * <strong>Data rights &amp; provenance:</strong> license posture, indemnities, content deals, opt-out compliance, synthetic-data pipeline maturity.</p>

[42] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Are there published studies or datasets since 2023 that measure the impact of adopting open-weight inference stacks on SME AI spending, AI-ops/headcount, or measured productivity-per-worker, and if so what quantitative changes do they report (e.g., % change in AI spend, % change in AI-ops hiring, or productivity metrics)? A: Short answer: Yes—since 2023 there are surveys and case studies showing cost/ROI gains from using open-weight/open-source models, but no widely‑cited, peer‑reviewed causal study that specifically measures SME-level changes in AI spend, AI‑ops/headcount, or productivity‑per‑worker tied solely to “adopting an open‑weight inference stack.” Examples: - Case study/analysis found replacing GPT‑4 API with open SLMs yielded estimated cost reductions of ~5×–29× in one production evaluation. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14972?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>) - IBM (Dec 2024) survey: 51% of orgs using open‑source AI report positive ROI vs 41% not using it (survey of IT decision‑makers). (No SME‑specific causal headcount/productivity figures). (<a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2024-12-19-IBM-Study-More-Companies-Turning-to-Open-Source-AI-Tools-to-Unlock-ROI?utm_source=chatgpt.com">newsroom.ibm.com</a>) - McKinsey/LF research &amp; industry reports document widespread use and perceived lower implementation (60%) and maintenance (46%) costs for open source AI, but these are survey/self‑reported metrics, not causal SME headcount/productivity studies. (<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/open-source-technology-in-the-age-of-ai?utm_source=chatgpt.com">mckinsey.com</a>) Conclusion: quantitative evidence exists (cost/ROI estimates and perceptions) but rigorous SME‑level causal measures of AI spend, AI‑ops hiring, or worker productivity due specifically to open‑weight inference stacks are still limited/absent.</p>

[43] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Are there published, empirical measurements of per-region p95 latency variance for federated or multi-host inference platforms over sustained windows (e.g., 30 days), and what magnitude of p95 variance (percentage or milliseconds) have those measurements reported? A: Short answer: No clear, public study exactly matches “per-region p95 latency variance for federated or multi‑host inference platforms measured continuously over ~30 days.” Existing empirical work is close but differs in scope or duration. Examples: - Cloud/infra studies report per‑link p95s in the microsecond→millisecond range (and large tail variability across regions/clouds). (<a href="https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2309.13169?utm_source=chatgpt.com">ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org</a>) - Distributed/serving papers report p95/p99 inference latencies of tens→hundreds of milliseconds and show large variability across deployment/topology and load, but over short experiments or per‑benchmark runs (not 30‑day per‑region windows). (<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2303.08028v3?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kserve/kserve/blob/master/docs/samples/multimodelserving/benchmark/BENCHMARK.md?utm_source=chatgpt.com">github.com</a>) - A fog/serverless study ran continuous 30‑day measurements of task latencies, but it evaluated general task execution (not federated inference per‑region p95 variance specifically). (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389128620311853?utm_source=chatgpt.com">sciencedirect.com</a>) If you need exact 30‑day per‑region p95 variance for a federated/multi‑host inference stack, it appears you’ll likely need to run long‑running probes (or request vendor telemetry), since public literature doesn’t publish that exact dataset.</p>

[44] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which vendors or model providers offer documented low-cost, regionally localized or regionalized models for non-English/low-resource languages, and what published pricing or deployment terms demonstrate cost parity or affordability for local deployers and civic organizations? A: Short answer — examples and evidence: - Meta / NLLB‑200 — large open MT models covering 200+ low‑resource languages; model cards and paper released (research/limited production licence varies). (<a href="https://huggingface.co/facebook/nllb-200-3.3B?utm_source=chatgpt.com">huggingface.co</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04672?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>) - UBC‑NLP / Cheetah &amp; SERENGETI — Afro‑focused models (covers 517 languages) released for research; downloadable checkpoints. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01053?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>, <a href="https://github.com/UBC-NLP/serengeti?utm_source=chatgpt.com">github.com</a>) - Hugging Face — hosts these regional models and documents low‑cost deployment options (Inference Endpoints from ~$0.033/hr CPU, small accelerator tiers ~$0.75/hr), enabling affordable self‑hosting or managed endpoints for civic groups. (Check each model’s license for production/commercial terms.) (<a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/pricing?utm_source=chatgpt.com">huggingface.co</a>) Note: explicit “cost‑parity” guarantees are rare; most providers publish model licenses + infra pricing (above), so affordability for local deployers depends on chosen model size, license (research vs commercial) and the cloud/edge instance selected.</p>

[45] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Since January 2024, which open-weight coalitions, foundations, or vendor consortia have published shared certification frameworks, indemnity templates, pooled red-team results, or standardized deployment playbooks intended to shorten procurement cycles, and which referenceable procurements or case studies document adoption of those coalition frameworks? A: Short answer — notable open/consortium outputs since Jan 2024 and documented procurement uptake: - MLCommons AI Safety working group — v0.5 AI‑safety benchmark / testing platform (Apr 15, 2024). (<a href="https://mlcommons.org/2024/04/mlc-aisafety-v0-5-poc/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">mlcommons.org</a>) - Frontier Model Forum — founding reports: Foundational Security Practices, Frontier Capability/Mitigation reports (2024–2025).

[46] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which independent third-party audits or verification reports of major foundation-model vendors’ safety claims and red-team artifacts are publicly available as of August 2025, and what are the main conclusions of those audits regarding model safety and operational risk? A: As of Aug 10, 2025, notable publicly available independent evaluations include: - US AISI (NIST) + UK AISI joint pre‑deployment technical report on Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet (Nov 19, 2024): found expert‑level bio/chem knowledge with dual‑use concerns, nontrivial cyber/agent capability, and safeguards that could routinely be circumvented in tested conditions. (<a href="https://www.nist.gov/document/us-aisi-uk-aisi-joint-testing-report-upgrade-claude-35-sonnet-111924">nist.gov</a>) - UK AISI technical evaluations of five public LLMs (May 2024, anonymized): models answered many advanced bio/chem questions, solved simple CTF cyber tasks, completed short‑horizon agent tasks but failed long‑horizon ones, and remained highly vulnerable to basic jailbreaks. (<a href="https://www.aisi.gov.uk/work/advanced-ai-evaluations-may-update">aisi.gov.uk</a>) - Large independent red‑teaming/benchmark studies (e.g., the Agent Red‑Teaming competition / ART benchmark, July 2025): showed high rates of policy violations across agents (many succeed within 10–100 queries), broad attack transferability, and persistent operational risks for deployed agents. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20526?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>) Takeaway: independent reports find rising capabilities (including dual‑use), persistent jailbreak/agent‑hijack vulnerabilities, and substantial operational risk; many evaluations are preliminary and call for standardized, ongoing third‑party verification.</p>

[47] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Since 2023, which publicly documented legal or regulatory cases resulted in model takedowns, re-licensing events, or regional restrictions due to ambiguous model licensing or lack of verifiable training-data provenance, and what were the publicly reported outcomes (e.g., takedown, relicense, fine, or reinstatement)? A: Short answer — three prominent, publicly documented examples: - Stable Diffusion 3 / Civitai (Jun–Jul 2024): Civitai temporarily banned/archived SD3 resources citing an ambiguous SD3 license; Stability AI revised the license (Stability AI Community License) and community platforms partially reinstated SD3 resources. (<a href="https://letscout.com/licensing-questions-plague-stability-ai-as-sd3-image-generator-gets-banned/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">letscout.com</a>) - Books3 dataset (Aug 2023): Danish Rights Alliance issued takedown requests that removed the Books3 pirate-books dataset from public hosts (the dataset was taken offline). (<a href="https://rettighedsalliancen.com/rights-alliance-removes-the-illegal-books3-dataset-used-to-train-artificial-intelligence/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">rettighedsalliancen.com</a>) - ChatGPT / Italy (Mar–Apr 2023; Dec 2024): Italy’s data-protection authority temporarily banned ChatGPT over unclear data‑processing/training practices (ban lifted after OpenAI made changes in Apr 2023); the Garante later fined OpenAI €15M for GDPR breaches (Dec 2024). (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-65431914?utm_source=chatgpt.com">bbc.com</a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/italy-fines-openai-15-million-euros-over-privacy-rules-breach-2024-12-20/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">reuters.com</a>) Note: many related lawsuits (NYT, Authors Guild, Getty, etc.) remain ongoing; outcomes about takedowns/re‑licensing often change as settlements, court orders, or license updates occur.</p>

[48] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which cross-vendor latency benchmark reports publish standardized p50 and p95 latency metrics and multi-region synthetic-canary results using consistent prompt sizes, instance types, warm/cold-start rules, and caching semantics, and what p50/p95 numbers do those reports list for leading closed APIs and leading open-weight inferencers? A: Short answer — no single public cross‑vendor report exactly meets all of your constraints (multi‑region synthetic “canary” + identical prompt sizes, instance types, warm/cold‑start rules, and caching semantics for both closed‑APIs and open‑weight inferencers). The closest, widely‑used sources are: - Artificial Analysis / LLM Performance Leaderboard — periodic synthetic API canary tests that report TTFT/latency percentiles (P50/P95) for closed APIs (examples: GPT‑4o ≈ P50 ~0.40s, P95 ~0.50–0.55s). (<a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/gpt-4o-chatgpt-03-25?utm_source=chatgpt.com">artificialanalysis.ai</a>) - Hugging Face / Optimum llm‑perf (and related llm‑perf leaderboards) — standardized runs for open‑weight inferencers with per‑request and per‑token P50/P95 (examples: local runs show per‑request P50 ≈0.40s, P95 ≈0.50s for small/medium configs; large models on GPUs show higher P95s up to ~1s+ depending on config). (<a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/optimum-benchmark/local?utm_source=chatgpt.com">huggingface.co</a>, <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/nemo-retriever/text-embedding/1.3.0/performance.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">docs.nvidia.com</a>) For rigorous hardware/server rules (but not multi‑region API canaries) see MLPerf Inference (strict instance/scenario rules, uses TTFT/TPOT thresholds rather than a single “multi‑region canary” feed). (<a href="https://mlcommons.org/benchmarks/inference-datacenter/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">mlcommons.org</a>) If you want, I can pull exact P50/P95 rows (by model and workload) from any of these sources and tabulate them. Which models and workloads do you want prioritized?</p>

[49] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: What publicly documented cases exist where closed-API vendors materially changed pricing, quotas, throttles, or quality-tier terms that resulted in more than a 2x increase in effective $/1k tokens for customers, and what public evidence (announcements, invoices, press reports) supports those cases? A: Short answer — three well-documented cases: - X / Twitter (removal of free API and paid tiers; later basic-tier hikes): developers saw API access costs jump (e.g., free → $100/mo in 2023, then basic increases later), effectively multiplying some customers’ unit cost well above 2×; documented in company developer posts and press reports.

[50] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: What total venture capital and mergers &amp; acquisitions investment into open-weight models and inference infrastructure was reported in the 12 months prior to August 2025, by amount and by source (public reports), and which public sources provide those investment totals? A: Short answer (period used: Aug 1, 2024 → Jul 31, 2025): no single public report aggregates “open‑weight models + inference infrastructure” for that exact 12‑month window. Closest publicly reported totals (by source and scope): - EY (Generative AI VC): $49.2B in VC into generative AI in H1 2025 (covers foundation‑model &amp; related deals). (<a href="https://www.ey.com/en_ie/newsroom/2025/06/generative-ai-vc-funding-49-2b-h1-2025-ey-report?utm_source=chatgpt.com">ey.com</a>) - S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence (GenAI infrastructure): ≈ $26B invested in GenAI infrastructure in calendar 2024 (infrastructure = chips, GPU clouds, tooling). (<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2025/1/genai-funding-hits-record-in-2024-boosted-by-infrastructure-interest-87132257?utm_source=chatgpt.com">spglobal.com</a>) - Crunchbase (foundation‑model funding snapshot): foundation‑model companies raised ~$5.5B in Q2 2025 (quarterly detail; useful for the 12‑month window but not a full 12‑month aggregate). (<a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/global-funding-climbs-q2-2025-ai-ma-data/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">news.crunchbase.com</a>) If you want, I can (a) compute a best‑effort 12‑month aggregate from deal‑level databases (Crunchbase/PitchBook) for Aug 1, 2024–Jul 31, 2025, or (b) fetch more source reports (PitchBook, CB Insights, S&amp;P monthly updates).

[51] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which vendors or projects publish normalized carbon-per-performance metrics for inference (for example CO2e per 1M tokens or CO2e per GPU-hour), and what reported values do they provide for comparable model families or inference configurations as of August 2025? A: Short answer — few vendors publish standardized per‑token CO2 metrics; most projects report per‑request energy or per‑GPU energy and let you convert to CO2. Representative publishers &amp; reported values (Aug 2025): - ML.ENERGY (benchmark + leaderboard): publishes measured per‑request energy (J) across 40 models on A100/H100 (leaderboard entries give J per generation which you can convert to Wh and gCO2e). They report huge spread (roughly 10^2–10^5 J per generation across models/tasks). (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.06371.pdf">arxiv.org</a>) - “How Hungry is AI?” (May 2025 paper): infrastructure-aware inference benchmark — example values: GPT‑4o short query ≈0.43 Wh; some high‑compute models (o3, DeepSeek‑R1) ≳33 Wh for long prompts. (Convert Wh→gCO2e by local grid intensity). (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09598?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>) - Hugging Face Open LLM Leaderboard / model‑cards: publishes per‑evaluation CO2 estimates (model‑specific inference runs); e.g., many community &lt;10B models measured ≲5 kg CO2 for their benchmark evaluation runs (setup‑specific). (<a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/leaderboard-emissions-analysis?utm_source=chatgpt.com">huggingface.co</a>) Note: units/methods differ (per‑response vs per‑token vs per‑GPU‑hour); convert using tokens-per-response, GPU power/time, and regional carbon intensity. If you want, I can convert any of the above into CO2e per 1M tokens (specifying model, prompt length, hardware, and region).</p>

[52] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which open-weight projects, model vendors, or inference hosts publicly provide human-centered enterprise documentation, explainability tooling, and admin UX materials aimed at procurement and compliance teams, and where are those artifacts published? A: Short list (public artifacts + where published): - Hugging Face (inference host + hub): enterprise/security &amp; admin docs (Inference Endpoints security, RBAC, PrivateLink) and model cards on the Hugging Face Docs / Hub. (<a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/inference-endpoints/security?utm_source=chatgpt.com">huggingface.co</a>) - Anthropic (model vendor): Trust/Transparency hub, enterprise security/compliance artifacts, model cards and developer/admin docs aimed at procurement/compliance. (<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/transparency/voluntary-commitments/security%26privacy?utm_source=chatgpt.com">anthropic.com</a>) - BigScience / BLOOM (open‑weights project): human‑centered model cards and datasheets published in the BigScience model_card repo and on the Hugging Face model pages. (<a href="https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/model_card?utm_source=chatgpt.com">github.com</a>) If you want, I can expand this into a vendor‑by‑vendor checklist (SOC2/DPA, model cards, admin console screenshots, explainability tools, links) for procurement review.</p>

[53] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which vendors publish measurable inclusion-related metrics such as multilingual z-scores, alt-text/image-description quality scores, assistive-technology compatibility tests, or low-bandwidth UX performance, and what numeric values do they report for these inclusion metrics? A: Short answer — examples of vendors/tools that publish measurable inclusion metrics and the numeric values they report: - Google (Lighthouse / PageSpeed Insights): Accessibility score 0–100 (weighted pass/fail audits); Core Web Vitals thresholds — LCP ≤2.5s (Good), INP ≤200ms (Good), CLS ≤0.1 (Good). (<a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/core-web-vitals?utm_source=chatgpt.com">developers.google.com</a>) - WebAIM (WAVE / The WebAIM Million): % pages with missing alt text ≈ 55.5% (2025); average ≈ 51 accessibility errors/page (Million report). (<a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/?lang=en&amp;utm_source=chatgpt.com">webaim.org</a>) - Microsoft Azure Computer Vision: image-caption/alt proposals include per-caption confidence (0–1); MS recommends ~0.4 as a practical threshold for Image Analysis 3.2. (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/concept-describing-images?utm_source=chatgpt.com">learn.microsoft.com</a>) - (Tooling) Deque axe, WAVE, IBM Equal‑Access, Accessibility Insights: publish rule/violation counts or CI-friendly scores (number of violations, error counts) via APIs/exports.

[54] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: What independent total-cost-of-ownership (TCO) studies or public analyses exist that compare end-to-end open-weight inference costs (including engineering for kernel tuning, quantization, lower multi-tenant GPU utilization, and p95 tail-latency overprovisioning) versus closed-API consumption, and what ranges of TCO difference (percentage or $/1M tokens) do those studies report? A: Short answer: there are a few academic / public analyses but no widely‑cited, fully independent TCO study that transparently and end‑to‑end accounts for kernel‑tuning engineering, quantization engineering, realistic multi‑tenant GPU utilization penalties and p95 over‑provisioning together. Public results (each covers different subsets) report very different gaps: - “Scaling Down to Scale Up” (U. of Michigan et al.) — self‑hosted SLMs showed ~5×–29× lower per‑token inference cost versus GPT‑4 in their setups (assumes high node utilization). (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14972?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>) - “Assessing Economic Viability” (ChipNeMo paper, Apr 2024) — domain‑adapted open models claimed ~90–95% lower TCO for that narrow use case. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08850?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>) - “Perseus” (multi‑tenant serving study) — shows multi‑tenancy and scheduling changes can change serving cost by ~10–12% and highlights tail‑latency tradeoffs. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02322?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>) Interpretation: reported ranges vary from modest (~10%) to very large (5×–20× or ~50–95%) depending on assumptions (utilization, model choice, whether engineering/ops costs are included); no single public study cleanly quantifies all the line items you listed.</p>

[55] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of August 2025, which major closed-API foundation-model vendors publicly publish pre-deployment red-team reports and documented training-data provenance, and for each vendor what level of detail is publicly available (e.g., full red-team reports, executive summaries, provenance manifests, or no disclosure)? A: Short answer — as of Aug 2025: - OpenAI — Publishes detailed system/model cards and red‑teaming whitepapers (rich pre‑deployment summaries and metrics), but not raw red‑team logs or full provenance manifests (only high‑level data categories, cutoffs, partners). (<a href="https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-system-card/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">openai.com</a>) - Anthropic — Publishes Frontier Red Team reports, blog analyses and model cards with training‑data summaries/cutoffs (substantive pre‑deployment writeups; no public provenance manifests).

[56] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: What published enterprise procurement surveys or studies since 2023 quantify the share or percentage of regulated-enterprise buyers that cite bundled compliance artifacts (SLA, SOC2, indemnities) and managed safety stacks as decisive factors when selecting foundation-model providers, and what attach-rate differences do those studies report between closed-API vendors and open-weight stacks? A: Short answer: I could not find any published survey since 2023 that <em>directly</em> reports the exact metric you asked for (the % of regulated‑enterprise buyers who name “bundled compliance artifacts (SLA, SOC‑2, indemnities) plus a managed safety stack” as a decisive single criterion, nor a study measuring attach‑rate differences <em>explicitly</em> between closed‑API vendors and open‑weight stacks). The closest, relevant published findings are: - Kiteworks (2025 buyer survey): 31% say “compliance” was a decisive factor in vendor choice; 63% seek detailed security/compliance info before engaging vendors. (<a href="https://www.securityinfowatch.com/cybersecurity/press-release/55291550/kiteworks-zero-day-threats-and-compliance-failures-forcing-a-rethink-of-vendor-selection?utm_source=chatgpt.com">securityinfowatch.com</a>) - G2 Buyer Behavior (2025): ~8 in 10 buyers now face stricter IT/security/legal evaluation for AI software; buyers demand accessible security docs during procurement. (<a href="https://learn.g2.com/2025-g2-buyer-behavior-report?utm_source=chatgpt.com">learn.g2.com</a>) - McKinsey (2024–25 Open‑Source/State of AI reports): &gt;50%+ of organizations use open‑source/open‑weight models (McKinsey: ~63% run an open model in production), while many cite security/compliance as a primary barrier—useful as a proxy but not an “attach‑rate” comparison. (<a href="https://upgrade.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/open-source-technology-in-the-age-of-ai?utm_source=chatgpt.com">upgrade.mckinsey.com</a>, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-2024?utm_source=chatgpt.com">mckinsey.com</a>) If you want, I can (a) pull the exact tables/figures from those reports, or (b) run a targeted search/FOIA/analyst‑report scan for vendor/industry procurement studies that may have proprietary attach‑rate data.</p>

[57] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Since 2023, are there publicly reported incidents where a regulatory order, IP lawsuit, leaked safety audit, or similar event caused measurable enterprise procurement pauses or customer churn for closed-API foundation-model vendors, and what churn rates or procurement impacts were publicly reported? A: Short answer: Yes — there are multiple publicly reported regulatory orders, leaks and company actions since 2023 that produced measurable procurement pauses or customer interruptions, but vendors rarely publish churn rates tied to those events. Examples (publicly reported impacts) - Italy’s data‑protection order (Garante) forced OpenAI to geoblock ChatGPT in Italy (Mar–Apr 2023); OpenAI disabled service there, issued ChatGPT‑Plus refunds and temporarily suspended renewals. (<a href="https://apnews.com/article/chatgpt-ai-data-privacy-italy-66634e4d9ade3c0eb63edab62915066f?utm_source=chatgpt.com">apnews.com</a>) - Corporate bans/pauses: large enterprises (Samsung, major banks, etc.) restricted ChatGPT use after leaks/concerns — Samsung’s internal ban and survey (≈65% of respondents said generative AI posed a security risk) are publicly reported. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/02/samsung-bans-use-of-generative-ai-tools-like-chatgpt-after-april-internal-data-leak/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">techcrunch.com</a>) - Vendor access cuts / commercial disruptions: targeted capacity/ access terminations (e.g., reported Anthropic access limits for a customer) have produced immediate procurement/availability impacts (news reports). (see press coverage). (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johanmoreno/2025/06/05/anthropic-cuts-windsurfs-claude-access-before-openai-acquisition/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">forbes.com</a>) Quantified churn data: vendors rarely link churn to single incidents; third‑party market snapshots report AI subscription churn/adoption (e.g., Cledara and Ramp analyses showing elevated monthly churn and changing vendor share), but these are aggregate and not causal.

[58] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which specific obligations, articles, or certification requirements in the EU Artificial Intelligence Act apply to general-purpose AI providers beginning 2 August 2025, and what documented provenance, controller/processor, or indemnity-related evidence do those obligations explicitly require for vendors to access regulated procurement in EU sectors? A: Short answer (effective 2 August 2025): providers of general‑purpose AI (GPAI) must comply with Article 53 (GPAI obligations) plus the GPAI-specific procedure/notification (Art. 52) and ancillary rules (Art. 54 on authorised representatives). Key, explicit documentary requirements are: up‑to‑date technical documentation meeting Annex XI (includes training‑data “type and provenance”, curation methods, architecture, FLOPs, test/evaluation results), a public training‑content summary (Annex/XII template), and a copyright‑compliance policy. The Commission’s GPAI guidelines and templates explain scope and the 2 Aug 2025 start date. (<a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/article/53/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">artificialintelligenceact.eu</a>, <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/guidelines-gpai-providers?utm_source=chatgpt.com">digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu</a>) What is NOT required by the AI Act itself: it does not mandate specific controller/processor contracts or contractual indemnities for procurement — those are governed by GDPR and procurement contracts. Contracting authorities commonly require conformity evidence, certificates/conformity assessment and may impose contractual indemnities and audit/processor‑agreement proof via model contractual clauses (MCC‑AI), but those are contractual/procurement requirements, not new statutory indemnity clauses in the AI Act.

[59] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which published field experiments, A/B tests, or vendor case studies report realized end-to-end cost reductions from hybrid prompt-routing architectures (drafting on low-cost open-weight inferencers, finishing on closed APIs), and what percentage cost savings did those studies observe? A: Short answer: There are few publicly‑published production A/B field studies that explicitly deploy “draft on open‑weight inferencer, finish on closed API” and report end‑to‑end dollar savings; most evidence is from lab/benchmark routing papers and vendor/internal case studies. Notable published results: - AWS (Bedrock) internal benchmarks / blog: reported cost savings in routing experiments of ~35%–56% (examples) and an RAG average of 63.6% fewer expensive calls in their tests. (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/use-amazon-bedrock-intelligent-prompt-routing-for-cost-and-latency-benefits/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">aws.amazon.com</a>) - Hybrid LLM (Dujian et al., 2024): router approach yielded up to ~40% fewer calls to the large model with no quality drop (calls‑reduction, not direct $). (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14618?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>) - Routoo (Mohammadshahi et al., 2024) / FrugalGPT (Chen et al., 2023): academic cascade/router experiments report ~1/3 cost reductions to &gt;2× reductions (and extreme lab cases up to ~98% in narrow tasks). (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13979?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>) If you want, I can search for production A/B case studies (dollar‑per‑request end‑to‑end) in specific industries or vendors.</p>

[60] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which public pricing comparisons or benchmark reports quantify the effective price gap between hyperscaler bundled offers (including compute credits and invoice consolidation) and independent inference hosts, and what percentage compression in $/1k tokens do those reports attribute to hyperscaler bundling? A: Short answer: I found public benchmarks and industry analyses that compare hyperscaler token/API pricing vs self‑hosted or independent inference providers, but I could not find any authoritative public report that isolates and quantifies the specific percentage compression in $/1k‑tokens attributable solely to “hyperscaler bundling” (compute credits + invoice consolidation). Most reports give overall price cuts or vendor TCO comparisons (e.g., 39–48% token-rate cuts reported across hyperscalers, or vendor vs. DIY TCO ratios), but do not break out the incremental $/1k‑token benefit that is strictly due to bundling. (<a href="https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/research/hyperscaler-genai-gets-cheaper-as-pricing-finds-its-level?utm_source=chatgpt.com">spglobal.com</a>, <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/cloud-prices-surge-with-rise-of-genai?utm_source=chatgpt.com">bcg.com</a>) Representative sources: - S&amp;P Global / 451 Research — documents large token‑rate cuts across hyperscalers (but not a bundling‑only squeeze).

(<a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2023/cloud-prices-surge-with-rise-of-genai?utm_source=chatgpt.com">bcg.com</a>) If you want, I can run a focused search on named vendors/providers (e.g., Bedrock/AzureOpenAI/Vertex vs. Vast.ai/Runpod/Together/DeepInfra) and compute example $/1k‑token deltas from current public price lists.</p>

[61] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of August 2025, which vendors or open-weight projects publish machine-readable training-data provenance manifests and signed content pipelines (including provenance schemas and cryptographic attestations), and where are those machine-readable provenance artifacts hosted? A: Short answer — as of Aug 2025, major vendors and open‑weight projects that publish machine‑readable provenance manifests + signed pipeline attestations include: - Sigstore / model‑transparency (open project): SLSA/in‑toto-style provenance examples and model‑signing demos (hosted on GitHub; attestations can be published alongside releases or in registries).

[62] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which foundation-model vendors or cloud providers publicly publish anonymized invoice-rate samples, committed enterprise invoice rates, or effective per-token pricing for enterprise customers, and where are those anonymized invoice-rate datasets or disclosures available? A: Short answer — vendors that publicly publish per‑token or committed throughput rates (not anonymized customer invoices) include: OpenAI (public API &amp; ChatGPT list pricing), Anthropic (per‑token + provisioned/commitment and batch discounts), and cloud marketplaces (AWS Bedrock publishes per‑token and provisioned/throughput committed hourly rates). Microsoft Azure and Google Vertex AI also publish token/unit pricing and point enterprises to sales for committed/discounted enterprise rates, but I could not find any vendor that publishes anonymized customer invoice‑rate datasets (vendor‑released anonymized invoice samples).

[63] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which blinded adversarial evaluation suites that test distributional and adversarial robustness have been published comparing open-weight and closed foundation models, and what parity or performance differentials (quantitative scores) did those blinded adversarial suites report? A: Short answer — published suites (some using blinded / “vision‑centric” designs) that directly compared open‑weight vs closed (API/private) foundation models and their reported differentials: - VHELM (CRFM, 2024): evaluated 22 VLMs and found closed‑API models “significantly outperform” open‑weight ones — e.g. PAIRS accuracies for top closed models 95.4% / 92.3% / 74.0% vs open‑weight models 0%–48.7%; automated red‑team prompts reduced safety scores by ≈25.9% on average. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07112?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>, <a href="https://crfm.stanford.edu/2024/11/08/helm-safety.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">crfm.stanford.edu</a>) - NaturalBench (NeurIPS/2024): vision‑centric adversarial VQA — 53 VLMs tested; most open models score only ~10–20% above chance, best closed models (e.g., GPT‑4o) still ~50–70 percentage‑points behind human accuracy (~90–95%). (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14669?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>) - HELM (CRFM, 2023): multi‑scenario robustness evaluation across 30 models — reported closed/private models generally outperform public/open ones; typical robustness/fairness drops of ~5–10 percentage points and larger (&gt;10 pp) gaps on knowledge/reasoning scenarios.

[64] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which publicly released evaluation batteries or benchmark suites include the combined components of (a) ensemble head-to-head capability (reasoning, code, multimodal), (b) adversarial prompt perturbations and jailbreak suites, (c) long-context stability tests up to 100k tokens, and (d) multilingual low-resource probes, and which vendors/models have published results on those batteries? A: Short answer: No single publicly released battery bundles all four components together. Instead, different suites cover different subsets: - Ensemble head‑to‑head (reasoning, code, multimodal): HELM / BIG‑Bench / aggregator platforms (OpenCompass) — many vendors (OpenAI GPT‑4/3.5, Google PaLM, Anthropic Claude, Meta LLaMA, etc.) report results on these.

[88] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which empirical studies, surveys, or field reports since 2023 measure small‑and‑medium enterprise (SME) adoption rates of open‑weight inference stacks and report associated sector‑level productivity or output‑per‑worker changes (for example percentage changes in productivity or annual output), and what adoption rates and productivity impacts do those studies report? A: Short answer: I could not find any empirical study (since 2023) that both (a) measures SME adoption rates specifically for “open‑weight inference stacks” and (b) simultaneously reports sector‑level productivity or output‑per‑worker changes. Closest, relevant sources: - Linux Foundation Research (2025) — large survey reports high use of open‑source AI (≈89% of AI‑using orgs) and firm‑level productivity/ROI claims, but does not provide SME‑level adoption rates tied to sector output‑per‑worker. (<a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/05/new-study-shows-open-source-ai-catalyst-economic-growth/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">about.fb.com</a>) - IBM / Morning Consult (Dec 2024) — survey of IT decision‑makers: open‑source AI users report higher ROI (51% vs 41%), but no SME‑specific open‑weight adoption × sector productivity estimates.

[89] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Are there published measurements or case studies showing that federated or multi‑host inference deployments reduced p95 latency and egress costs compared to centralized hosting over a sustained window (for example 30 days); if so, which publications and what measured reductions in p95 latency and egress charges are reported? A: Short answer: Yes—but evidence is mixed. Several research papers and vendor case studies report lower tail latency and/or lower egress/costs from edge, federated or multi‑host inference; however, peer‑reviewed studies that publish direct p95 + egress comparisons measured continuously over a sustained 30‑day window are rare (most are lab benchmarks or monthly billing case studies). Examples: - SpecEdge (May 2025) — edge-assisted LLM serving: ≈11.2% inter‑token latency reduction and 1.91× better cost‑efficiency vs server‑only. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17052?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>) - EdgeSight (2024) — edge–DC prototype: up to 1.6× improvement in P90 (and P99/P100 gains reported). (<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.19213?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>) - Expedia/Alluxio (industry case) — cross‑region caching halved S3 egress spend (reported as monthly savings).

A: Short answer: No — I could not find any published scorecard, academic paper, or industry report that implements that exact composite called an “Inclusive Reach Score” (multilingual z‑score + alt‑text precision + assistive‑tech compatibility + low‑bandwidth UX) and then reports numeric scores for major model families. Component evaluations do exist (multilingual benchmarks, alt‑text/caption metrics, accessibility-focused benchmarks, UX/efficiency studies), but I found no authoritative work that aggregates those four into a single published numeric score.

[91] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which audited invoices, independent pricing analyses, or benchmark reports since 2023 document that high‑volume procurement using open‑weight models on efficient inferencers (quantization, model‑packing, spot/reserved GPUs) reduced effective cost ($/1k or $/1M tokens) by approximately 50% versus closed‑API pricing, and what ranges of savings are reported? A: Short answer — Yes. Independent benchmark/price‑analysis reports since 2023 show large savings from self‑hosting open‑weight models with quantization, model‑packing and spot/reserved GPU procurement; reported effective reductions versus closed‑API rates range from ~40% up to 80–96% (i.e., ~2×–25× lower $/token) depending on utilization, model and infra assumptions. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2312.14972v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>, <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2023/05/03/mosaicml-launches-inference-reduce-enterprise-generative-ai-deployment-costs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">siliconangle.com</a>) Representative sources - “Scaling Down to Scale Up” (Dec 2023): case study finds 5×–29× cost reductions vs GPT‑4 under conservative 80% node utilization (≈80–96% savings).

[92] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which published enterprise procurement surveys or studies (citing regulated buyers) quantify the reduction in pilot‑to‑production time when vendors provide managed closed‑API bundles (SLA, SOC2, indemnities, SSO/data‑residency), and what median percentage reduction in pilot→production time do those studies report? A: Short answer: I could not find any published enterprise procurement survey or peer‑reviewed study that specifically measures (and reports a median percentage for) the reduction in pilot→production time that is attributable to vendors offering a bundled “managed closed‑API” package (SLA + SOC‑2/HITRUST + indemnities + SSO/data‑residency) for regulated buyers. What is available: authoritative sources and buyer surveys report that third‑party assurance/compliance materially shortens vendor onboarding and sales cycles (examples: Gartner reports ~90‑day median onboarding; AWS startup case/anecdote reports SOC‑2 cutting complex procurement follow‑ups by “as much as a month”; 6sense quantifies ~20 days shaved when solution importance rises).

A: Short answer (as of Aug 10, 2025): - UK &amp; U.S. AI Safety Institutes (joint pre‑deployment evaluations) — Anthropic Claude 3.5 “Sonnet” (published Nov 19, 2024) and OpenAI o1 (published Dec 18, 2024). Findings: models’ capabilities were roughly comparable to reference systems; measurable cyber/biological/software‑development capabilities and dual‑use risks were identified; red‑teaming revealed jailbreaks and capability improvements versus prior versions; results were shared with vendors and characterised as preliminary, limited-scope tests that require ongoing, larger‑scale evaluation. (<a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/11/pre-deployment-evaluation-anthropics-upgraded-claude-35-sonnet?utm_source=chatgpt.com">nist.gov</a>) - Independent NGO review — Future of Life Institute “AI Safety Index” (Dec 11, 2024): concluded wide disparities in safety practice across leading vendors, universal vulnerability to jailbreaks, and need for stronger third‑party/ regulatory oversight. (<a href="https://futureoflife.org/document/fli-ai-safety-index-2024/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">futureoflife.org</a>) Notes: many vendor red‑team reports and internal white papers exist (e.g., Gemini/Google DeepMind), but truly independent, published audits remain limited in scope; agencies emphasised the preliminary nature of current assessments and recommended more standardized, repeatable third‑party testing.</p>

[94] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which published field experiments, vendor A/B tests, or case studies quantify token‑volume or latency reductions from prompt‑pipeline optimizations (prompt compression, retrieval‑summary drafting, early‑exit/progressive decoding), and what percentage cost savings are reported when hybrid routing (open‑weight drafting + closed‑API finishing) is used? A: Short answer — published/peer‑reviewed results that quantify token/latency gains: - Microsoft LLMLingua (EMNLP / MSR): up to ~20× prompt compression; end‑to‑end latency speedups 1.7–5.7× and 20–30% response‑token reductions. (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/llmlingua-innovating-llm-efficiency-with-prompt-compression/">microsoft.com</a>) - TCRA‑LLM (EMNLP’23): retrieval‑summary (summarization) compression cut retrieval token size ≈65% (semantic pruning ≈20% w/ small accuracy hit). (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15556">arxiv.org</a>) - Chain‑of‑Draft (arXiv 2025): “CoD” uses as little as 7.6% of Chain‑of‑Thought tokens (≈92% token reduction), lowering cost/latency on evaluated tasks. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18600">arxiv.org</a>) On hybrid routing (open‑weight drafting + closed‑API finishing): academic “Hybrid LLM” routing reports up to 40% fewer calls to the expensive model (the commonly‑reported proxy for cost savings). Full replacements of closed APIs with open SLMs show 5×–29× cost reductions in one production study — but public A/B case studies that report exact % savings for the specific draft‑then‑finish hybrid pattern are limited. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14618">arxiv.org</a>)</p>

[95] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Do any major foundation‑model vendors or independent benchmark reports publish the operational metric ‘provisioned GPU‑seconds per 1M in+out tokens’ measured under a declared p95 latency SLA, quantization level, and batching policy; if so, which vendors/reports publish it and what numeric values are reported? A: Short answer: No — I could not find any major vendor or independent benchmark that directly publishes the operational metric exactly as phrased (“provisioned GPU‑seconds per 1M in+out tokens” measured under a declared p95 latency SLA, quantization level, and batching policy). Vendors/benchmarks do publish the component pieces (tokens/sec or tokens/sec per GPU, p‑percentile latencies, quantization and batch settings) so the metric can be computed, but the combined, declared “GPU‑seconds per 1M tokens @ p95 with stated quantization+batching” is not published as a standard, ready‑made number. (<a href="https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/performance/perf-overview.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">nvidia.github.io</a>, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/resources/mlperf-benchmarks/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">nvidia.com</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/api-priority-processing?utm_source=chatgpt.com">openai.com</a>) Examples to check (you can compute the metric from these): NVIDIA TensorRT‑LLM perf tables (tokens/sec by precision and batch). MLPerf/ vendor MLPerf entries (system tokens/sec and latencies). OpenAI enterprise SLA page (latency SLA but no GPU‑seconds). (<a href="https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/performance/perf-overview.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">nvidia.github.io</a>, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/resources/mlperf-benchmarks/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">nvidia.com</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/api-priority-processing?utm_source=chatgpt.com">openai.com</a>)</p>

[96] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which benchmark reports, vendor performance disclosures, or public case studies quantify p50/p95 latency improvements attributable to SRE practices for model serving (for example multi‑AZ synthetic canaries, warm‑pool serving, sharded batching), and what magnitudes of p95 reduction or tail‑risk improvements are reported? A: Brief summary (public benchmarks / case studies with quantified tail improvements): - Sarathi‑Serve (MSR/OSDI paper): reports P99 tail (TBT) falling from ~1.08s to ~0.29s (≈73% reduction) for one workload and 2.6–5.6× higher serving capacity vs. vLLM/Orca. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2403.02310v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>) - ParaServe (arXiv, 2025): focuses on cold‑start mitigation for serverless LLMs — reports up to 4.7× reduction in cold‑start latency and up to 1.74× improvement in SLO attainment. (paper reports cold‑start improvements rather than explicit p95 in all cases). (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15524?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>) - AWS (SageMaker warm pools, training jobs): P90 job startup fell from ~136s to ~19s (≈86% reduction) when warm pools were used — an example of warm‑pool gains (training-focused). (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/best-practices-for-amazon-sagemaker-training-managed-warm-pools/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">aws.amazon.com</a>) Note: public vendor case studies often report P99/cold‑start multipliers or throughput gains rather than standardized p50/p95 for specific SRE practices (multi‑AZ canaries, sharded batching); if you want, I can compile a wider list.</p>

[97] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which reproducible interpretability toolchains, mechanistic probes, or standardized adversarial harnesses for auditing open‑weight checkpoints were published since 2023, and are there documented enterprise audit reports that used these toolchains; please list the toolchains and any corresponding enterprise audit sources? A: Short list (since 2023) of reproducible/mechanistic/adversarial toolchains for auditing open‑weight checkpoints — with whether I found public enterprise audit reports using them: - Tracr (compiled transformers; 2023) — mechanistic testbeds. - TransformerLens / Transformer‑internals tooling (ongoing; widely used in mech‑interp since 2023). - HarmBench (standardized automated red‑teaming / adversarial harness; 2024). - InterpBench / TracrBench (semi‑synthetic benchmarks for validating circuit‑discovery; 2024). - Causal‑tracing for vision–language (BLIP) and Attention Lens (2023) — modality‑specific mech‑interp tools. I did not find publicly documented enterprise audit reports that explicitly state using these specific toolchains (public audits most often cite custom/internal frameworks or general benchmarks). If you want, I can (1) produce direct links to the papers/repos above and (2) run a targeted search for any named corporate/consulting audit reports that cite a specific tool.

[98] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which vendors publicly publish per‑record training‑data provenance or signed license/consent metadata (i.e., record‑level manifests linking training examples to source and license) for datasets used to train foundation models as of August 2025, and where are those per‑record manifests hosted? A: Short answer — public, record‑level provenance/manifests are rare; notable public examples (Aug 2025): - Together Computer — RedPajama: per‑document JSON records (url/source/timestamp) + listings/sha256 manifests hosted on Together’s object storage (https://data.together.xyz/) and mirrored on Hugging Face datasets. (<a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data-1T/blob/main/README.md?utm_source=chatgpt.com">huggingface.co</a>) - LAION — LAION‑5B / LAION image collections: per‑image metadata (URLs, captions, license/source tags) published by LAION and distributed via their site and Hugging Face dataset exports/cloud stores. (<a href="https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">laion.ai</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/huggingface_hub_metadata?utm_source=chatgpt.com">huggingface.co</a>) - The Common Pile / EleutherAI (The Pile): datasets with per‑example “meta” fields and repo manifests hosted on GitHub / Hugging Face (and archived mirrors).

[99] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which vendors or inference hosts publicly publish normalized carbon intensity metrics (for example CO2e per 1M tokens or CO2e per GPU‑hour) for inference as of August 2025, and what numeric CO2e values do they report for comparable model families or configurations? A: Short answer (as of Aug 2025): - Google Cloud — publishes Compute Carbon Intensity (CCI: g CO2e per Exa‑FLOP). Example (paper/table): TPU v4i ≈ 346 gCO2e/Exa‑FLOP (market‑based) vs TPU v6e/“Trillium” ≈ 118 gCO2e/Exa‑FLOP (location/market variants shown in the paper). (<a href="https://ar5iv.org/abs/2502.01671">ar5iv.org</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/sustainability/tpus-improved-carbon-efficiency-of-ai-workloads-by-3x">cloud.google.com</a>) - Hugging Face (Open LLM Leaderboard) — publishes per‑model inference CO2 estimates (per evaluation/run on their test infra). Example: many community &lt;10B models reported ≲5 kg CO2 per benchmark run on HF’s evaluation setup; per‑model numbers are available in their leaderboard/colab. (<a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/leaderboard-emissions-analysis">huggingface.co</a>) - AWS &amp; Microsoft Azure — both publish customer‑facing emissions tools/methodologies (AWS Customer Carbon Footprint Tool; Azure Carbon Optimization / Emissions Insights) and service/instance emission data (enabling normalization to e.g. CO2e per VM/GPU‑hour), but they do not publish a single vendor canonical “CO2e per 1M tokens” for hosted model families. (See AWS CCFT and Azure carbon‑optimization docs.) (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/04/customer-carbon-footprint-tool-updated-methodology/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">aws.amazon.com</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/carbon-optimization/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com">learn.microsoft.com</a>) If you want, I can pull the exact table rows/leaderboard model IDs and numeric per‑run values into a short CSV.</p>

[100] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which documented case studies or public deployments exist where open‑weight models hosted on low‑cost inference endpoints were used by civic organizations or non‑English/low‑resource communities to deliver localized assistants, and what quantitative deployment outcomes (for example cost per 1k tokens, user counts, or usage metrics) are reported? A: Short answer — documented examples are sparse; most civic/vernacular pilots report user counts or monthly hosting costs but not standardized “cost per 1k tokens.” - UNCTAD (UN): built an open‑source RAG LLM stack and reports running it on a single GPU Azure VM costing ≈USD 144/month (on‑demand; ≈USD 77/month with longer term) for organization‑wide access — paper documents the deployment and cost but not a per‑1k‑token figure. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16896.pdf">arxiv.org</a>) - Pratham (India): deployed a WhatsApp early‑childhood assistant (BaalSakhi) built on Meta Llama (open weights); Meta/partners report ~40k+ mothers reached — no public per‑token or detailed cost metrics. (<a href="https://prathamusa.org/pratham-chatgpt-baalsakhi/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">prathamusa.org</a>, <a href="https://telecomtalk.info/meta-says-opensource-ai-transforming-healthcare-outcomes/987907/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">telecomtalk.info</a>) - InkubaLM / Lelapa AI: an open 0.4B model for African languages (Hugging Face release) intended for local deployments — authors/press describe pilots and community use but publish no public deployment usage or per‑token cost metrics. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17024?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>, <a href="https://www.ictworks.org/how-inkubalm-is-revolutionizing-locally-led-development-in-africa/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">ictworks.org</a>) If you want, I can dig deeper for any of these (e.g., request cost/throughput benchmarks or contact project writeups) and pull precise token‑cost estimates from typical low‑cost inference stacks.</p>

[101] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which independent benchmark reports since January 2024 document that open‑weight model variants (including distillations, QLoRA or 4‑bit quantized forks) achieve at least a 30% lower inference cost ($/1k tokens or $/1M tokens) at comparable task‑level quality versus corresponding closed‑API models, and what cost differentials do those reports cite? A: Short answer — two independent academic reports since Jan 2024 explicitly report ≥30% lower inference cost for open‑weight variants versus closed‑API models: - Laboratory‑Scale AI (May 27, 2024) — finds few‑shot/fine‑tuned open models cost roughly 10× less than GPT‑4‑Turbo (i.e., open models ≈90% cheaper in their few‑shot comparisons). (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16820?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>) - Bridging the LLM Accessibility Divide? (Mar 14, 2025) — for automated‑essay scoring the authors report Llama‑3 can be up to ~37× more cost‑efficient than GPT‑4 (i.e., ~97% lower cost in that use case). (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11827?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>) Caveat: both results are task‑ and setup‑specific (few‑shot vs fine‑tuned, particular benchmarks); many other papers show large efficiency gains for quantized/distilled models but do not directly compare $/token to closed APIs. If you want per‑token ($/1k or $/1M) numbers from each report I can extract the exact tables/lines.</p>

[102] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which published enterprise procurement studies since 2023 quantify enterprise attach rates or market share (percentage of regulated‑enterprise buyers) in favor of hyperscaler/closed‑API bundled governance packages versus open‑weight stacks, and what percentages or attach‑rate comparisons do those studies report? A: Short answer: I found no publicly‑available study since 2023 that directly measures the percentage of regulated‑enterprise buyers who prefer “hyperscaler/closed‑API bundled governance” versus “open‑weight” stacks. Instead, analyst and vendor research quantifies hyperscaler marketplace adoption and procurement pain points (which imply, but do not numerically compare, governance‑bundle vs open‑stack choices): - Canalys (2023–2024): hyperscaler marketplace sales = US$16B in 2023; Canalys notes &gt;99% of AWS top‑1000 have ≥1 active marketplace subscription and forecasts marketplace growth to US$85B by 2028. (<a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/hyperscaler-cloud-marketplace?utm_source=chatgpt.com">canalys.com</a>, <a href="https://canalys.com/reports/hyperscaler-marketplaces-software-channels?utm_source=chatgpt.com">canalys.com</a>) - Cloud‑marketplace vendor surveys (Clazar/2025): 89% of companies transact on hyperscaler marketplaces; 22% report &gt;20% revenue via marketplaces. (<a href="https://clazar.io/blog/state-of-cloud-marketplace-and-co-sell-in-2025-report-insights?utm_source=chatgpt.com">clazar.io</a>) - Buyer‑sentiment research (HFS/IBM, Dec 2023): 34% cite vendor‑lock‑in as a top source of hyperscaler “buyer’s remorse”; 26% reported terminating a hyperscaler contract in prior 12 months. (<a href="https://www.hfsresearch.com/research/its-time-to-throw-open-the-clouds-exit-doors/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">hfsresearch.com</a>) If you’d like, I can (a) search paywalled analyst reports (Gartner/Forrester/IDC) for sector‑specific procurement numbers, or (b) run targeted surveys/papers for regulated sectors (finance, healthcare, govt).</p>

[103] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which public pilots or example projects (for example Sigstore SLSA/in‑toto demos, GitHub Artifact Attestations, or cloud provider content‑credential pilots) published end‑to‑end example provenance manifests for released models prior to August 2025, and where can those example manifests or pilot artifacts be accessed? A: Short answer — public examples published before August 2025: - Sigstore “model‑transparency” (end‑to‑end SLSA + in‑toto examples for trained models, CIFAR10 samples, model signing CLI and sample provenance bundles) — repo + docs (attestation/predicate examples and CLI). (<a href="https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency?utm_source=chatgpt.com">github.com</a>, <a href="https://sigstore.github.io/model-transparency/model_signing.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">sigstore.github.io</a>) - GitHub Artifact Attestations / SLSA usage (GitHub published the feature + how‑to and CLI commands to download/verify attestations for released artifacts); many public repos expose attestations via the GitHub Attestations UI (example: HuggingFace/safetensors releases showing SLSA attestations). (<a href="https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/introducing-artifact-attestations-now-in-public-beta/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">github.blog</a>, <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors/attestations?utm_source=chatgpt.com">github.com</a>) If you want, I can fetch specific example manifest files (e.g., a CIFAR10 provenance JSON from sigstore/model‑transparency or a downloaded GitHub attestation JSONL) and paste the exact manifest links.</p>

[104] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Are there public procurement decisions, RFPs, or public‑institution procurement records since 2023 that explicitly cite open‑weight transparency artifacts (model cards, community red‑team logs, downloadable checkpoints) as the reason for selecting open‑weight models over closed APIs, and can you provide examples and sources? A: Short answer: I could not find any public RFP/award record since 2023 that explicitly states “we selected the open‑weight model because of its model card / community red‑team logs / downloadable checkpoints.” Public procurement guidance, however, increasingly requires or encourages asking for model cards and other transparency artifacts, and governments/agencies have publicly adopted open‑weight models for reasons like auditability and on‑prem hosting. Examples: UK procurement guidance recommending suppliers provide model cards; FTC commentary on “open‑weights” benefits/risks; Meta’s announcement making Llama available to U.S. government agencies (shows uptake of open weights). If you want, I can run deeper Freedom‑of‑Information/SAM.gov/Contracts‑Finder searches for specific awarded contracts and return any that do include that explicit language. (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ppn-0224-improving-transparency-of-ai-use-in-procurement/ppn-0224-improving-transparency-of-ai-use-in-procurement-html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">gov.uk</a>, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/policy/advocacy-research/tech-at-ftc/2024/07/open-weights-foundation-models?utm_source=chatgpt.com">ftc.gov</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/meta-says-its-making-its-llama-models-available-for-us-national-security-applications/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">techcrunch.com</a>)</p>

[105] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which vendors or projects (for example Hugging Face, Anthropic, BigScience) have published human‑centered enterprise artifacts such as model cards, RBAC/security documentation, and admin UX guides as of August 2025, where are those artifacts hosted, and are there any documented procurement case studies linking those artifacts to improved pilot→production conversion? A: Short answer — as of Aug 10, 2025: - Hugging Face — full Model Card tooling + individual model cards on the Hugging Face Hub (model README.md) and enterprise admin/RBAC &amp; security docs in their Hub docs (Organisations, Resource Groups, Audit Logs, Enterprise features). (<a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/model-cards?utm_source=chatgpt.com">huggingface.co</a>) - Anthropic — published model/system cards (Claude family) plus an enterprise “Trust/Compliance” center and admin/SSO/role-audience documentation (docs.anthropic.com; AWS Marketplace listing for Claude for Enterprise). (<a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/resources/claude-3-model-card?utm_source=chatgpt.com">docs.anthropic.com</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/awsmarketplace/anthropics-claude-for-enterprise-now-available-in-aws-marketplace/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">aws.amazon.com</a>) - BigScience (BLOOM) — public model cards (BLOOM model card) hosted on the Hugging Face model page and GitHub repo. (<a href="https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom-3b?utm_source=chatgpt.com">huggingface.co</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/model_card?utm_source=chatgpt.com">github.com</a>) I did not find publicly posted procurement case‑studies that explicitly attribute improved pilot→production conversion to those human‑centered artifacts; many vendor customer stories describe smoother production adoption but do not isolate documentation/RBAC/model‑cards as the causal factor. If you want, I can run a focused search for vendor trust‑portal procurement artifacts or academic procurement studies.</p>

[106] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Have any published evaluation suites or academic/industry benchmark reports implemented a ‘Prompt Robustness Curve’ that measures model z‑scores across controlled adversarial perturbations and multiple temperature settings and reports an AUC/variance stability metric; if so, which reports and do they document correlation with production A/B outcomes? A: Short answer: I could not find any published academic or public industry report that exactly implements a “Prompt Robustness Curve” as you described (model z‑scores across controlled adversarial prompt perturbation levels × decoding temperatures with an AUC/variance stability summary) nor one that publishes a documented correlation between that exact metric and production A/B outcomes. Related work tests overlapping pieces (e.g., adversarial prompt benchmarks, prompt‑stability scores, perturbation/robust‑prompt methods) but not the full temperature × z‑score × AUC pipeline or public A/B correlation. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2306.04528">arxiv.org</a>, <a href="https://openai.com/safety/evaluations-hub/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">openai.com</a>) If you want, I can (a) scan specific corpora/tech blogs or closed industry system-cards for any unpublished/gray‑literature examples, or (b) draft a reproducible evaluation recipe that computes the exact Prompt Robustness Curve + AUC and how to test A/B correlation.</p>

[107] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which public procurement RFPs, procurement guidance documents, or enterprise RFP templates explicitly reference NIST AI RMF, BigScience/BLOOM datasheets, Hugging Face model cards, ML.ENERGY metrics, or similar artifacts as expected verification materials, and provide examples and sources? A: Short answer — documented examples exist: - NIST RFI (Dec 21, 2023) — explicitly asks for information on “forms of transparency and documentation (e.g., model cards, data cards, system cards, benchmarking results, impact assessments…)” as inputs for NIST’s AI work (i.e., expected verification/transparency artifacts). (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/12/21/2023-28232/request-for-information-rfi-related-to-nists-assignments-under-sections-41-45-and-11-of-the?ref=hatemail.io">federalregister.gov</a>) - NIST’s Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute (AISI) notice (Federal Register) and related NIST solicitations explicitly tie evaluation/TEVV work to the NIST AI RMF and request capabilities for model evaluation/benchmarks.

[108] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which foundation-model vendors publicly publish machine-readable provenance manifests (for example C2PA, SLSA, sigstore or similar artifact attestations) for released models as of August 2025, and where are those manifests hosted or accessible? A: Short answer — very few major FM vendors had public, machine‑readable attestations for the model binaries themselves by Aug 2025. Confirmed examples and where to find them: - NVIDIA — publishes signed models, SBOMs and model‑signing information in the NGC Catalog; signatures/public‑key and verification instructions are available via the NGC documentation and API. (<a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/gpu-cloud/ngc-catalog-user-guide/index.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">docs.nvidia.com</a>) - Tooling / reference implementations — Sigstore / OpenSSF model‑signing and the sigstore “model‑transparency” examples show SLSA/sigstore workflows for signing models and publishing attestations (GitHub repo / model‑signing packages). (<a href="https://github.com/sigstore/model-transparency?utm_source=chatgpt.com">github.com</a>, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/model-signing/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">pypi.org</a>) - Major cloud/FMs (OpenAI, Microsoft/Azure, Amazon, Google) have publicly adopted C2PA or announced model‑signing work — they publish C2PA “content credentials” for generated media and/or model‑signing guidance, but broadly published machine‑readable attestations for downloadable foundation‑model binaries are not clearly documented as universally available (check each vendor’s model/NGC/Vertex/Azure/Bedrock docs for per‑model manifests).

[109] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which closed‑API foundation‑model vendors publicly provide packaged legal and compliance artifacts (SLA/DPA templates, SOC2 reports, indemnity language, red‑team summaries) on their public documentation portals as of August 2025, and are there documented procurement studies quantifying the time savings achieved by reusing those artifacts? A: Short answer (as of Aug 10, 2025): - Vendors that publicly publish packaged legal/compliance artifacts on their public docs/trust portals: OpenAI (DPA, business terms/indemnity language, SOC‑2 + trust/security portal and system cards/red‑team summaries), Anthropic (Trust/Transparency hub: SOC2/DPA, system cards, indemnity in commercial terms), Google Cloud (Cloud DPA, SOC reports, Gemini transparency notes), Microsoft/Azure (Azure OpenAI transparency note, Azure/Office DPA/SLA materials), and AWS (Bedrock/legal pages + AWS Artifact SOC reports). Many other commercial model vendors (Cohere, Mistral, Stability AI, etc.) run public “trust” pages with similar artifacts. (<a href="https://trust.openai.com/?tcuUid=136828cf-2e85-42e5-874d-61ddcd9014df&amp;utm_source=chatgpt.com">trust.openai.com</a>, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/transparency/voluntary-commitments/security%26privacy">anthropic.com</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/terms/data-processing-addendum/index-20240523?utm_source=chatgpt.com">cloud.google.com</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/transparency-note?utm_source=chatgpt.com">learn.microsoft.com</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/console/artifact?utm_source=chatgpt.com">docs.aws.amazon.com</a>) - Procurement studies: I found no independent, peer‑reviewed procurement study that quantifies exact time‑savings from reusing those packaged vendor artifacts. Analyst reports and vendor/automation‑tool case studies (Gartner, Whistic/Drata/UpGuard marketing &amp; case posts) report substantial workflow/time benefits, but they are not independent procurement‑level quantifications. (<a href="https://gcom.pdo.aws.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-05-08-gartner-predicts-half-of-procurement-contract-management-will-be-ai-enabled-by-2027?utm_source=chatgpt.com">gcom.pdo.aws.gartner.com</a>, <a href="https://www.whistic.com/resources/blog/ai-response-comparison-study?utm_source=chatgpt.com">whistic.com</a>) If you want, I can (a) fetch the exact DPA/SLA/indemnity pages for each vendor, or (b) gather the vendor/tool case studies and analyst reports that estimate time savings.</p>

[110] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which open‑weight inference hosts or vendors publicly offer enterprise‑grade SLAs, signed indemnities, and SOC/ISO compliance packaging as of August 2025, and where are those enterprise offerings and contract terms documented? A: Short answer (as of August 10, 2025): - Google Cloud (Vertex AI / Duet): public generative‑AI indemnity + enterprise SLA and full SOC/ISO trust center. Documentation: Google “Protecting customers…” (generative‑AI indemnity) and Google Cloud Trust Center. (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/protecting-customers-with-generative-ai-indemnification/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">cloud.google.com</a>) - Microsoft Azure (Azure OpenAI / Azure AI): Customer Copyright Commitment (output/train‑data indemnity), Azure AI SLAs and Azure compliance pages (SOC/ISO).

Documentation: Bedrock SLA + AWS Customer Agreement / Trust Center. (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/sla/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">aws.amazon.com</a>) - OpenAI (Enterprise/Business): publishes SOC2/compliance materials and business terms that include IP indemnities for paid/enterprise tiers; SLAs/availability remedies are included in negotiated Enterprise/Foundry terms. Documentation: OpenAI Business Terms and Security pages. (<a href="https://openai.com/policies/aug-2023-business-terms/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">openai.com</a>) Note: many other inference hosts (Hugging Face, Stability AI, CoreWeave, Lambda, specialist managed‑inference providers) publish SOC/SLA or enterprise pages but indemnity language is typically in negotiable MSAs — check each vendor’s Enterprise/Legal or Trust Center and request the MSA/SLA/DPA during procurement.</p>

[134] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Have any published scorecards, academic papers, or industry reports implemented a Procurement Friction Index (PFI) that weights SLA/uptime 25%, compliance artifacts 20%, indemnity clarity 15%, admin UX/docs 20%, regional data‑residency 10%, and integration toolkits 10%; if so, which publications implemented it and what predictive performance (e.g., correlation with pilot→production conversion) did they report? A: Short answer: No — I could not find any published scorecard, academic paper, or industry report that implements a Procurement Friction Index with those exact component weights (SLA/uptime 25%, compliance artifacts 20%, indemnity clarity 15%, admin UX/docs 20%, regional data‑residency 10%, integration toolkits 10%) or that reports a predictive metric (e.g., correlation with pilot→production conversion) for that exact index. Existing related work includes Tungsten’s Friction Index (procure‑to‑pay friction, 2017) and a 2024 academic “Procurement Delay Index (PDindex)”, but neither uses your specific weighted PFI nor reports pilot→production correlation.

[135] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Are there public 30‑day multi‑region synthetic canary studies that compare a federated/region‑local hosting strategy versus centralized hosting and report both the percentage p95 latency reduction and dollars egress saved per 1M tokens; if so, which studies and what reductions/savings were reported? A: Short answer: I could not find any public study that exactly matches all your criteria (a 30‑day, multi‑region synthetic‑canary comparison of federated/region‑local vs centralized hosting that reports both % p95 latency reduction and $ egress saved normalized to “per 1M tokens”). Related work exists (multi‑region LLM/load‑balancing papers report latency and cost tradeoffs, but not a 30‑day canary + $/1M‑token egress figure). For example, SkyLB (May 2025) reports 1.74–6.30× lower latency and ~25% cost reduction for multi‑region LLM serving but isn’t a 30‑day synthetic‑canary study nor does it report $/1M tokens. AWS CloudWatch Synthetics now retains 30‑day canary history (Mar 15, 2024), which enables such studies. If you want, I can (a) continue searching narrower sources, or (b) propose an experiment design to produce those exact metrics.

[136] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Have any public or vendor A/B trials compared closed‑only serving versus an open‑draft + closed‑finish hybrid routing for representative production prompts over a 30‑day period, measuring tokens and $/1k saved, p50/p95 latency, embedding Draft‑to‑Finish Delta, safety‑fix rate, and user‑satisfaction delta; if so, which trials and what percentage cost or latency savings and safety impacts were reported? A: Short answer: I could not find any public or vendor A/B trial that ran a 30‑day production A/B comparing closed‑only serving vs an open‑draft + closed‑finish hybrid that reported all the metrics you listed (tokens and $/1k saved, p50/p95 latency, embedding draft→finish delta, safety‑fix rate, and user‑satisfaction delta). Public work is mostly academic/benchmarks or OSS demos that report cost/latency gains for hybrid routing or draft+verify approaches (examples report ~20–40% fewer expensive calls or cost reductions down to ~16–25% of baseline in published experiments), but not a 30‑day production A/B with the full metric set you specified.

[137] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Have any vendors or benchmarking studies published an SRE‑adjusted operational metric defined as GPU‑seconds per 1M tokens × (1 + p95‑tail reserve %) ÷ measured usable GPU utilization (or an equivalent formulation); if so, which reports and what numeric values do they report for comparable model families and serving configurations? A: Short answer: I could not find any public vendor or benchmarking report that explicitly publishes that exact SRE‑adjusted composite metric (GPU‑seconds per 1M tokens × (1 + p95‑tail reserve%) ÷ measured usable GPU utilization). Instead, vendors/studies publish the metric components (tokens/sec or cost per 1M tokens, p95/p99 latencies or latency distributions, and GPU utilization) which you can combine yourself. Examples: NVIDIA’s LLM inference cost guidance and token‑cost examples, TensorRT‑LLM and NIM perf pages that report tokens/sec and p95 latencies, and independent cost/price‑performance analyses that compute $/1M tokens from utilization assumptions.

A: Short answer (as of August 10, 2025): I could not find any public evidence that a major vendor or benchmark report publishes a single, signed machine‑readable “Safety Audit Passport” JSON that bundles red‑team metrics, a full provenance summary, SOC2/DPA status, indemnity pointers, p50/p95 latency rows, and capability z‑scores all together.

[139] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which vendors publicly report a marginal CO2e per 1M tokens metric at a declared p95 latency SLA and specified GPU utilization (normalized by region and GPU class) as of August 2025, and what numeric CO2e values do they report for comparable model families or inference configurations? A: Short answer: none publish all three pieces together (marginal CO2e per 1M tokens + a declared p95 latency SLA + GPU‑utilization normalized by region &amp; GPU class) as of Aug 2025. Major vendors remain opaque on that exact, combined disclosure. (<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-carbon-emissions-energy-unknown-mystery-research?utm_source=chatgpt.com">wired.com</a>) Partial public disclosures: - Mistral — published a lifecycle audit that reports a marginal inference cost of 1.14 g CO2e for a 400‑token generation (≈2.85 kg CO2e per 1M tokens). This is a marginal/inference figure but not published together with p95 SLA + normalized GPU‑utilization. (<a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jul/22/mistral-environmental-standard/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">simonwillison.net</a>) - Hugging Face — provides GPU energy / “AI Energy Score” (energy per 1k tasks) that can be converted to CO2 by region, but it does not publish the full triple (per‑1M‑tokens CO2e at declared p95 and normalized GPU‑utilization). (<a href="https://huggingface.github.io/AIEnergyScore/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">huggingface.github.io</a>) If you want, I can (a) compute per‑1M‑token CO2e from vendor or research numbers for specific models/regions, or (b) compile a short table of estimated values from research papers.</p>

A: Short answer: I found no public vendor (as of Aug 10, 2025) that publishes a single “Accessibility &amp; Inclusion Compliance Pack” containing all six artifacts together. I did find the individual artifacts published separately by different vendors/initiatives: - WCAG / accessibility conformance reports (ACRs / VPATs): vendors such as Adobe publish ACRs on their accessibility/compliance pages. (<a href="https://www.adobe.com/accessibility/compliance/adobe-admin-console-04-2024-acr.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">adobe.com</a>) - Inclusive‑reach / representation scores (ad/media inclusivity): XR/Extreme Reach publishes its RX/Representation Index for advertising assets.

[141] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Are there published empirical macroeconomic studies or modelled analyses (since 2023) that estimate the effect of large‑scale adoption of low‑cost open‑weight inference on service‑sector consumer price inflation within a 12–24 month window, and if so what effect sizes or ranges do those studies report? A: Short answer: I could not find any published empirical or modelled paper (since 2023) that specifically isolates “large‑scale adoption of low‑cost open‑weight inference” and reports a direct estimate for service‑sector consumer‑price inflation over a 12–24 month horizon. I did find modelled analyses of broad AI adoption (not explicitly “open‑weight inference”) that report short‑run disinflationary pressure turning inflationary later — eg. BIS (April 2024) calibrates a 1.5 pp TFP lift and shows initial lower inflation, with aggregate inflation peaking ≈+0.75 percentage points at ~4 years in an “unanticipated” scenario and &gt;+2 pp in an “anticipated” scenario. These are aggregate results, not a 12–24‑month service‑CPI estimate, and I did not find a study that reports a narrow 12–24 month service‑sector CPI effect for open‑weight inference specifically. (<a href="https://www.bis.org/publ/work1179.pdf">bis.org</a>) If you want, I can run a deeper systematic search for working papers, central‑bank notes or industry analyses that may address “open‑weight” inference specifically.</p>

[142] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which major hyperscaler marketplaces (for example AWS Marketplace, Azure Marketplace, Google Cloud Marketplace) offer ‘compliance‑wrapped’ marketplace SKUs for third‑party or open models that include unified billing, regional data‑residency controls, and contractual risk‑wrappers as of August 2025; list the SKUs and published terms? A: As of August 10, 2025: major hyperscaler marketplaces (AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud) offer “compliance‑wrapped” marketplace SKUs for third‑party/open models (unified billing, regional deployment/data‑residency choices, and standardized marketplace contracts/private‑offer wrappers). Examples and published terms: - AWS Marketplace — e.g., Anthropic listings (Claude-for-Enterprise / Bedrock model SKUs such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet) sold via Marketplace with consolidated AWS billing and optional Standard Contract for AWS Marketplace (SCMP) or private‑offer EULAs. (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/awsmarketplace/anthropics-claude-for-enterprise-now-available-in-aws-marketplace/">aws.amazon.com</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/standardized-license-terms.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">docs.aws.amazon.com</a>) - Microsoft Azure Marketplace / Azure OpenAI — model deployment SKUs: Global, Data‑Zone (US/EU) and Regional SKUs (billing via Azure subscription; offers may use Microsoft’s Standard Contract + Marketplace amendments). (<a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">azure.microsoft.com</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/legal-contracts?utm_source=chatgpt.com">learn.microsoft.com</a>) - Google Cloud (Vertex AI Model Garden / Marketplace) — partner MaaS model SKUs (Anthropic, Llama, Mistral, Hugging Face deployments) with region/data‑residency options and Google Marketplace Vendor Agreement (merchant/contract terms). (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/partner-models/use-partner-models?utm_source=chatgpt.com">cloud.google.com</a>) If you want, I can extract the exact Marketplace product IDs/SKU strings and the linked EULA/SCMP/Marketplace agreement PDFs for a selected model/provider.</p>

[143] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Are there public tracking datasets, media‑analytics reports, or procurement databases that count the share or percentage of government/policy press mentions and procurement RFPs invoking the terms ‘open‑weight’, ‘model card’, or ‘auditability’ since 2023; if so, what trend (percentage change or counts) do those sources report up to August 2025? A: Short answer: No — I could not find any publicly posted, pre‑aggregated dataset or media/procurement report (through Aug 10, 2025) that already publishes the share/percentage trend since 2023 for government/policy press mentions and procurement RFPs specifically invoking the three exact terms “open‑weight”, “model card”, and “auditability.” What exists and can be queried to produce those counts: Media Cloud and GDELT for media time‑series (they return hits and % of stories over time), SAM.gov / FPDS for U.S. federal solicitations, and model‑card collections analyzed in academic work (e.g., a 32K‑model‑card analysis). You’d need custom queries on those sources to compute the trends; therefore the aggregated percent‑change/count trend is unknown until someone runs those queries.

[144] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of August 2025, which vendors publicly supply standardized p50/p95 latency metrics and $/1k‑token cost metrics produced under community benchmarking rules (for example MLPerf Inference, llm‑perf/Optimum, Hugging Face leaderboards, ML.ENERGY), and what p50/p95 and $/1k values do they report for leading models? A: Short answer (Aug 2025): - Hugging Face / ArtificialAnalysis leaderboard: publishes community‑style p50/p95 TTFT and throughput percentiles and blended token price (they report $/1M, convertible to $/1k). Example: OpenAI GPT‑4o (March 2025) — TTFT p50 ≈ 0.40s, p95 ≈ 0.60s; price reported $7.50 per 1M tokens (≈ $0.0075 / 1k). (<a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/leaderboard-artificial-analysis">huggingface.co</a>, <a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/gpt-4o-chatgpt-03-25?utm_source=chatgpt.com">artificialanalysis.ai</a>) - MLCommons (MLPerf Inference): many vendors (NVIDIA, AMD, Google, Lenovo, HPE, Lambda, CoreWeave, etc.) publish standardized latency percentiles (TTFT/TPOT p50/p95) for LLM workloads under MLPerf rules — MLPerf does NOT publish $/token; price must be obtained from cloud/vendor pricing and combined with MLPerf throughput to compute $/1k. Example MLPerf v5.0 shows NVIDIA B200/DGX GB200 top Llama results (tokens/sec and percentile latency metrics available in submission reports). (<a href="https://mlcommons.org/2025/04/mlperf-inference-v5-0-results/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">mlcommons.org</a>, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/resources/mlperf-benchmarks/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">nvidia.com</a>) Note: some cloud vendors (e.g., AWS) publish p50/p99 latency and cost-per‑1M‑inference in their docs (convertible to $/1k only with an assumptions about tokens-per‑inference).

[145] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Since 2023, have any vendors adopted and published a standardized ‘Enterprise TCO per 1M tokens’ procurement template disclosing list price, typical committed/spot discounts, egress &amp; bandwidth assumptions, GPU‑seconds/token, assumed GPU utilization, expected engineering FTE‑months for integration/tuning, SLA credit terms, and sample invoice scenarios; if so, which vendors and where are those templates published? A: Short answer: I could not find any vendor that has publicly published a single, standardized “Enterprise TCO per 1M tokens” procurement template that lists all of the exact fields you named (list price + typical committed/spot discounts, egress/bandwidth assumptions, GPU‑seconds/token, GPU utilization assumptions, expected engineering FTE‑months, SLA credit language, and sample invoice scenarios). Vendors publish partial pieces (detailed per‑model token pricing, SLA pages, and TCO or build‑vs‑buy calculators) but not one canonical procurement template covering every item. (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/cost-management/unlock-the-true-cost-of-enterprise-ai-on-google-cloud?utm_source=chatgpt.com">cloud.google.com</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/sla/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">aws.amazon.com</a>, <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/dhuynh95/ai-tco-calculator?utm_source=chatgpt.com">huggingface.co</a>) If you want, I can (a) search specific vendors/contracts (OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft, Google, AWS, Cohere, Hugging Face) for non‑public/customer templates or (b assemble a reusable procurement template that combines best‑practice fields and realistic assumptions. Which would you prefer?</p>

[146] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which public case studies, vendor reports, or benchmark experiments demonstrate that implementing automated model failover (blue/green, shadowing), warm pools, traffic mirroring, and scripted rollback playbooks reduced mean time to recovery (MTTR) or p95 latency tail risk for model serving; for each source, what MTTR or p95 reductions (absolute ms or percent) were reported? A: Brief list of public sources that report measurable MTTR or tail‑latency improvements from failover/warmpool/shadowing/automated rollback for model (or AI) serving: - SkyServe (EuroSys/2024–25): multi‑replica failover (spot→on‑demand) improved P50/P90/P99 latency by ~2.3×/2.1×/2.1× (i.e., ~57%/52%/52% reduction vs alternatives). (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01438">arxiv.org</a>) - ParaServe (arXiv 2025): serverless LLM cold‑start mitigation (pipeline parallel warm‑fetching) reduces cold‑start latency up to 4.7× (≈79% reduction in worst cold‑start latency). (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15524">arxiv.org</a>) - FailLite (arXiv 2025): warm replicas + progressive failover for edge model serving produced end‑to‑end recovery (MTTR) ≈175.5 ms (absolute MTTR reported). (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15856?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>) If you’d like vendor/blog benchmarks (AWS Lambda Provisioned Concurrency / SnapStart, SageMaker warm pools) with absolute p95/ms examples, I can add those.</p>

[147] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which mechanistic interpretability toolchains (for example neuron‑activation tracing, causal probing, circuit discovery frameworks) have been used in published enterprise audits of open‑weight models since 2023, and do any published audit reports document a reduction in post‑audit incidents or identify mitigated backdoors/poisoning (with quantitative incident counts)? A: Short answer: public, published enterprise audit reports since 2023 almost never report using mechanistic‑interpretability toolchains (activation/attribution patching, causal probing, automated circuit discovery); those techniques remain primarily in academic papers and research toolkits. Enterprise audits instead publish results from static/file scanners, malware/serialization checks, black‑box red‑teaming, membership/canary tests and governance reviews. I found no published enterprise audit report that (a) documents using neuron‑activation tracing / circuit discovery as its principal remediation tool and (b) gives a verifiable, post‑audit quantitative reduction in incidents attributable to those mechanistic fixes. Security reports have published counts of discovered malicious/poisoned models (e.g., JFrog/Hugging Face ≈100+ flagged models) but not post‑audit incident‑reduction tallies tied to mechanistic interpretability remediations.

A: As of August 10, 2025, several major vendors/projects publicly publish collections that together match the “Trust &amp; Usability Bundle” elements (provenance summaries/model‑cards, in‑product provenance badges, accessible explanations/confidence displays, recourse/appeal/reporting flows, frontline onboarding materials, and UX/evaluation reports). Notable examples and where to find the artifacts: - Microsoft — Responsible AI Transparency report, Responsible AI tooling + Content‑credentials deployment (LinkedIn) and Copilot adoption/onboarding kits. (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/responsible-ai-transparency-report/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">microsoft.com</a>, <a href="https://adoption.azurewebsites.net/en-us/copilot/user-engagement-tools-and-templates/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">adoption.azurewebsites.net</a>) - OpenAI — public system cards (GPT‑4o, Sora, o1) with provenance, watermark/C2PA plans, evaluations and deployment/UX learnings. (<a href="https://openai.com/index/sora-system-card/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">openai.com</a>) - Hugging Face — model‑card tooling, annotated model‑card guide + user‑study materials and Hub metadata/flags. (<a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/main/model-cards?utm_source=chatgpt.com">huggingface.co</a>) Many other vendors (Google PAIR, Adobe, NVIDIA) publish overlapping artifacts but not always the full six‑item bundle in one place; check their model‑card, PAIR/guidebook, or provenance pages for details.</p>

[149] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which open‑weight hubs or repositories (for example Hugging Face model hub, GitHub repos hosting model weights) experienced measurable developer‑ecosystem growth in the 12 months prior to August 2025—reported as percent increases in model‑hub downloads, repo forks, adapter/plugin releases, or SDK stars—and what were those growth rates? A: Short answer — two well‑reported cases: - Hugging Face / Meta Llama (model downloads): downloads rose from ~350M (Aug 2024 report) to ~1.0B by Mar 18, 2025 — ≈2.86× (≈+186% vs. Aug 2024). (<a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/meta-leads-open-source-ai-boom-llama-downloads-surge-10x-year-over-year/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">venturebeat.com</a>, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/03/celebrating-1-billion-downloads-llama/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">about.fb.com</a>) - ollama (GitHub repo; developer ecosystem via stars): GitHub star count grew ~261% (added ~76k stars) over 2024. (<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/22/the-20-hottest-open-source-startups-of-2024/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">techcrunch.com</a>) Sources show these concrete percent/growth claims; other hubs (Hugging Face overall model count, Google’s Gemma downloads, many LLaMA‑derivative repos) also report large increases but either report absolute milestones rather than a single 12‑month % or require combining snapshots — I can compute additional exact 12‑month %s if you want specific repos/hubs and exact start/end dates.</p>

[150] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which regional ‘Model Stewardship Labs’ (municipal or civic testbeds) have published localized fine‑tunes, audit‑ready model cards, standardized TCO/safety playbooks, or reference deployments intended to support public procurement since 2023, and are there documented procurement outcomes or citations referencing those labs? A: Short answer — confirmed examples (since 2023): - Mobility Lab / Forum Virium Helsinki (regional civic testbed) — published Helsinki-focused pilots, open procurement calls and reference pilot deployments (AI-in-Mobility winners; Mobility Lab open calls / pilot procurements). Documented award amounts and pilot reports available. (<a href="https://forumvirium.fi/en/ai-in-mobility-challenge-winners-selected/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">forumvirium.fi</a>) - AI4Cities (six‑city EU pre‑commercial procurement coordinated with city testbeds including Amsterdam, Helsinki, Paris region, Copenhagen, Stavanger, Tallinn) — ran RfTs/PCP to source AI solutions for city procurement; public tender documents and follow‑on procurement records exist. (<a href="https://forumvirium.fi/en/ai4cities-launches-its-request-for-tenders-to-find-ai-solutions-accelerating-carbon-neutrality/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">forumvirium.fi</a>) - New York City (AI Action Plan / OTI) — published citywide AI guidance, an AI‑specific procurement pathway and deployed the MyCity chatbot (trained on NYC content); the plan and deployment are documented by city materials and press.

[151] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of August 2025, which foundation-model vendors have publicly obtained EU AI Act conformity assessments, published technical documentation formatted to Annex XI/XII, appointed EU authorised representatives, and published cryptographically signed training‑data provenance manifests; for each vendor, where are those artifacts hosted? A: Short answer — none that I could verify publicly. I found no public evidence (as of 2 Aug 2025) that any foundation‑model vendor has simultaneously published: (a) a completed EU AI‑Act conformity assessment, (b) full technical documentation formatted to Annex XI/XII, (c) an appointed EU authorised representative mandatized under Article 54, and (d) cryptographically‑signed training‑data provenance manifests. Major vendors (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic) have published Annex‑style technical material and run EU entities/offices, and model‑signing/provenance tooling (Sigstore/OSS) exists — but I could not find vendor‑hosted, signed training‑data manifests or publicly posted conformity‑assessment reports.

[152] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Have any published studies implemented the proposed Prompt Robustness Curve (PRC) protocol and reported the correlation (for example Spearman or ROC) between PRC AUC and short production A/B outcomes (rollback rate, CSAT, hallucination incidents, SLA errors); if so, which studies and what correlation coefficients were reported? A: Short answer: I could not find any publicly available, peer‑reviewed or preprint study (through Aug 10, 2025) that implemented the Prompt Risk Control / Prompt Robustness Curve (PRC) protocol and reported a quantitative correlation (Spearman, ROC/AUC, etc.) between PRC AUC and short production A/B outcomes (rollback rate, CSAT, hallucination incidents, SLA errors). The original PRC paper (Zollo et al., ICLR 2024) gives PRC experiments on chat/summarization/code but does not report production A/B correlations, and follow‑on robustness papers also do not publish those correlations. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2311.13628">arxiv.org</a>) If you want, I can (a) search company blog posts/tech reports or gray literature for internal A/B analyses, or (b) run a systematic search for unpublished corpora/technical notes that might contain those correlations.</p>

[153] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Since January 2023, which open‑weight consortia or coalitions have published standardized record‑level provenance schemas together with shared indemnity templates, and are there any public procurement decisions or RFPs that cite or reference those coalition artifacts? A: Short answer (≤150 words): - Provenance specs: several open coalitions have published record‑level provenance schemas since Jan 2023 — notably the C2PA “Content Credentials” technical spec (C2PA) and longstanding W3C PROV / PROV‑O family; research/coalition work (Data Provenance Initiative; DataONE/ProvONE) has published record‑level extensions and tooling. (<a href="https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">c2pa.org</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-dm/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">w3.org</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16787">arxiv.org</a>) - Indemnity templates: I could not find any publicly‑posted, coalition‑endorsed “shared indemnity” templates bundled with those provenance schema releases. That is an absence of published artifacts (not proof none exist). (Searches of C2PA, W3C and Data Provenance Initiative materials turned up no public indemnity template.) (<a href="https://c2pa.org/specifications/specifications/2.0/specs/C2PA_Specification.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">c2pa.org</a>, <a href="https://github.com/DataONEorg/sem-prov-ontologies?utm_source=chatgpt.com">github.com</a>) - Procurement / RFPs: governments and diplomatic fora have publicly engaged with or piloted C2PA (e.g., C2PA/Embassy of France briefings; UK parliamentary submissions mention C2PA), but I found no public RFP/award that explicitly cites a coalition’s provenance spec + a shared indemnity template.

A: Short answer — several public bodies and multistakeholder groups have published “audit‑translator”‑style procurement kits since 2023 that are aimed at legal/procurement teams. Notable examples and where to get them: - World Economic Forum (AI Procurement in a Box — workbook, checklists and templates). (<a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/ai-procurement-in-a-box/workbook/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">weforum.org</a>) - Government of Canada (Directive on Automated Decision‑Making + online Algorithmic Impact Assessment — scoring, impact‑level mapping and mitigation requirements).

[156] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of August 2025, which major foundation‑model vendors (for example OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, Google) publicly publish cryptographically signed, machine‑readable provenance manifests (using standards such as Sigstore SLSA/in‑toto, GitHub attestations, or C2PA) for released models, and where are those manifests hosted or accessible? A: As of August 10, 2025: public, cryptographically‑signed, machine‑readable provenance manifests for model artifact releases are still uncommon among the big vendors. - OpenAI: publishes C2PA “Content Credentials” for generated images (DALL·E 3) — but I found no public Sigstore/SLSA/in‑toto attestations for OpenAI model weight releases. (<a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8912793-c2pa-in-dall-e-3%23.otf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">help.openai.com</a>) - Anthropic: publishes model cards (Claude) but I found no public signed model manifests/attestations for released model files. (<a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/resources/model-card?utm_source=chatgpt.com">docs.anthropic.com</a>) - Meta: Llama weights are distributed (Hugging Face / Meta pages) but I did not find vendor-published Sigstore/GitHub attestation or C2PA manifests attached to those weight releases. (<a href="https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-hf/blob/main/README.md?utm_source=chatgpt.com">huggingface.co</a>) - Mistral: their GitHub repos show “No attestations” (no GitHub Artifact Attestations/Sigstore bundles) for inference releases. (<a href="https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-inference/attestations?utm_source=chatgpt.com">github.com</a>) Practical exceptions: many model artifacts hosted on public hubs (Hugging Face, PyPI, GitHub releases) can and sometimes do carry GitHub/Sigstore attestations (hosted in GitHub’s Attestations UI / Sigstore Rekor), but vendor adoption remains sporadic. If you want, I can check specific model pages and return any signed manifests and Rekor entries.

[180] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which public benchmark reports or vendor studies have run contract‑aware synthetic outage scenarios (peering loss, egress throttle, region blackout) and published numeric worst‑case p95 latency uplift and incremental $ egress per 1M tokens; provide the studies and reported p95/egress deltas? A: Short answer: I could not find any public benchmark or vendor study that simultaneously (a) ran contract‑aware synthetic outage scenarios (peering loss / egress‑throttle / region blackout) and (b) published numeric worst‑case p95 latency “uplift” together with incremental $ egress per 1M tokens. Relevant near‑misss (report parts that overlap, but do NOT give the paired p95+$/1M‑token values you asked for): - ThousandEyes postmortems (peering/BGP outages; packet‑loss and reachability timelines but no token‑egress $/1M).

A: Short answer: I could not find any peer‑reviewed or independent published evaluation that specifically measures the impact of 1–2 hour “AI for Executives” tabletop modules + a one‑page red‑team translator on procurement KPIs (pilot→production conversion or time‑to‑contract). Instead, only vendor/consultant case studies and reports with related but different interventions exist—for example: - ProcurementTactics (vendor) claims “teams report 70% faster RFP/contract prep” and “most teams earn back 5–7× the fee inside 90 days.” (<a href="https://procurementtactics.com/ai-fundamentals-for-procurement-teams/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">procurementtactics.com</a>) - The Hackett Group (consultancy) reported ~49% of procurement orgs piloted GenAI, vendors saw up to ~10% productivity/cost improvements and some orgs reported ~25% gains.

[188] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which published studies, vendor reports, or benchmark papers have implemented a ‘Prompt Efficiency Score’ (PES) defined as quality per tokens (z‑scored) with cost‑latency contours, and what predictive performance (for example correlation with A/B cost‑quality outcomes or percent cost savings when used for routing) did those publications report? A: Short answer (search performed Aug 10, 2025): I found no published paper or vendor report that explicitly defines a “Prompt Efficiency Score (PES)” as “quality per tokens (z‑scored) with cost‑latency contours” or that reports PES’s predictive correlation with A/B cost‑quality outcomes or percent cost‑savings when used for routing. I did find related work that measures quality-vs-token/cost tradeoffs and reports efficiency gains: - PromptOptMe (Larionov &amp; Eger) — 2.37× token reduction with no loss in MT evaluation quality. - PREMISE — reports up to 87.5% reduction in reasoning tokens and 69–82% dollar cost reduction while matching accuracy on math tasks. - CAPO (Cost‑Aware Prompt Optimization) — multi‑objective optimization that reports up to ~21 percentage‑point gains and lower prompt length/budget for many tasks. If you want, I can (a) run a deeper targeted search for industry benchmarks / vendor whitepapers (Slack/Docs/blogs) or (b) compile an annotated table of which papers report which exact predictive metrics.</p>

[189] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which public-sector procurements, buyer RFPs, or procurement frameworks (with sources and dates) have, as of August 2025, implemented a prequalification or fast‑track that requires vendors to submit Annex XI/XII‑formatted technical documentation, appoint an EU authorised representative, provide SOC2/DPA evidence, and publish a signed machine‑readable Safety Audit Passport? A: Short answer: I could not find any public‑sector procurement, buyer RFP or procurement framework (as of 10 Aug 2025) that implements a pre‑qualification / fast‑track which simultaneously requires (1) Annex XI/XII‑formatted technical documentation, (2) appointment of an EU authorised representative, (3) SOC2/DPA evidence, and (4) publication of a signed machine‑readable “Safety Audit Passport.” Notes &amp; sources (representative evidence): - EU AI Act requires Annex XI/XII technical documentation for general‑purpose models and mandates authorised representatives (Articles 53–54; obligations applicable from 2 Aug 2025). (<a href="https://ai-act-text.com/article-53-ai-act?utm_source=chatgpt.com">ai-act-text.com</a>, <a href="https://www.aiact-info.eu/article-54-authorised-representatives-of-providers-of-general-purpose-ai-models/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">aiact-info.eu</a>) - The EU Public Buyers Community / Commission published updated AI procurement model clauses and guidance (Mar–Jun 2024–2025) — supports uptake of AI‑specific contract requirements but is guidance, not a single procurement imposing all four items. (<a href="https://public-buyers-community.ec.europa.eu/communities/procurement-ai/news/updated-eu-ai-model-contractual-clauses-now-available?utm_source=chatgpt.com">public-buyers-community.ec.europa.eu</a>) - SOC2 / DPA evidence is frequently requested in separate public RFPs (examples exist in US/state and sector tenders), but these do not concurrently reference Annex XI/XII + Safety Audit Passport. (example SOC2 RFP: US state notice, 2025). (<a href="https://www.highergov.com/sl/contract-opportunity/al-rfp-for-soc2-type2-audit-52893278/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">highergov.com</a>) If you want, I can (a) run a jurisdiction‑by‑jurisdiction TED / national procurement portal search (EU Member States, UK, US states) to try to locate any narrow/local RFP that does combine all four, or (b) monitor newly posted frameworks for combinations of these requirements. Which would you prefer?</p>

[190] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which vendors or independent reports, as of August 2025, publish machine‑readable CO2e per 1M tokens values and carbon‑aware SLA terms (for example declared carbon‑adjusted pricing or carbon risk multipliers), and what numeric CO2e values and SLA provisions are included in those public disclosures? A: Short answer (as of Aug 10, 2025): - Mistral AI — published a peer‑reviewed LCA giving a marginal inference figure: 1.14 g CO2e per 400‑token response (≈2.85 kg CO2e per 1,000,000 tokens). (Mistral LCA). (<a href="https://mistral.ai/fr/news/our-contribution-to-a-global-environmental-standard-for-ai?utm_source=chatgpt.com">mistral.ai</a>) - Hugging Face / Open LLM Leaderboard — publishes machine‑readable per‑evaluation CO2e estimates (CSV/JSON datasets you can download) but not a standardized “per‑1M tokens” field (you can compute it from their run-level energy/CO2 numbers). (<a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/leaderboard-emissions-analysis?utm_source=chatgpt.com">huggingface.co</a>, <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/leaderboards/blob/main/docs/source/en/open_llm_leaderboard/emissions.md?utm_source=chatgpt.com">github.com</a>) - Major cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) — provide machine‑readable carbon‑footprint exports/APIs for resources (Customer Carbon Footprint Tool / Cloud Carbon Footprint) but they do not publish vendor‑controlled “CO2e per 1M tokens” nor public SLAs that embed carbon‑adjusted pricing or explicit “carbon‑risk multipliers.” (see AWS CCFT; GCP Carbon Footprint). (<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/ccft-overview.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">docs.aws.amazon.com</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/carbon-footprint/docs/release-notes?utm_source=chatgpt.com">cloud.google.com</a>) Bottom line: independent model LCAs (e.g., Mistral) and community leaderboards give per‑inference numbers (convertible to per‑1M tokens); cloud providers expose machine‑readable resource emissions — but as of Aug‑2025 no major vendor publishes a standard machine‑readable CO2e per‑1M‑tokens metric together with public carbon‑adjusted SLA/pricing multipliers.</p>

[191] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which vendors or cloud providers have published measured ‘Failover Continuity Rate’ SLOs (percentage of scheduled 60s full‑traffic automated failovers that maintained per‑region p95 ≤ declared SLA and near‑zero error‑rate over a rolling 30‑day window), and what numeric continuity rates were reported with sources? A: Short answer — none found publicly. I searched major providers’ SLA/reliability publications and public reliability reports and did not find any vendor that has published a measured “Failover Continuity Rate” SLO exactly matching your definition (scheduled 60s full‑traffic automated failovers that preserved per‑region p95 ≤ declared SLA and near‑zero error‑rate over a rolling 30‑day window) with a numeric continuity percentage. Major clouds publish SLAs and describe DR/failover testing (AWS, Google, Azure) but not that exact, measured continuity‑rate metric in public docs as of 2025‑08‑10. (<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/legal/service-level-agreements/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">aws.amazon.com</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/reference/business-continuity?utm_source=chatgpt.com">cloud.google.com</a>) For context: work on formalizing availability/continuity measurement is underway in standards (IETF/IPPM drafts), which explains why vendors report related SLOs but not this precise measured metric publicly. (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-mhmcsfh-ippm-pam/01/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">datatracker.ietf.org</a>) If you want, I can (a) search vendor blog posts/whitepapers and third‑party audits for any narrower matches, or (b) draft a measurement spec you can run to produce this metric yourself.</p>

[192] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which vendors, procurement bodies, or published studies have defined or published a ‘Frontline Adoption &amp; Trust’ composite metric (combining onboarding completion time, end‑user comprehension %, WCAG accessibility level, and recourse/appeal success rate), and what numeric scores or reported outcomes did each publish as of August 2025? A: Short answer: I found no public evidence (vendor, procurement body, or peer‑reviewed study) that a named “Frontline Adoption &amp; Trust” composite metric—explicitly combining onboarding completion time, end‑user comprehension %, WCAG accessibility level, and a recourse/appeal success rate—had been published as of 10 Aug 2025. I checked major vendor adoption scores (which track uptake/time‑to‑value), WCAG accessibility publications, and recent papers on algorithmic recourse/appeals; each reports related component metrics but not that exact composite. (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/adoption/adoption-score?view=o365-worldwide&amp;utm_source=chatgpt.com">learn.microsoft.com</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/REC-WCAG21-20230921/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">w3.org</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2403.14467v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>) If you want, I can (a) run targeted searches of specific vendors/procurement agencies (GSA, UK GDS, NHS, Microsoft, Google, AWS) or (b) file a deeper literature/grey‑literature sweep and return any partial or unpublished frameworks.</p>

[193] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of August 2025 which managed open‑weight hosting providers publicly advertise MSA‑ready offerings (SOC2/HIPAA packaging, negotiable indemnities, and published SLA/indemnity terms), and where are those SLA/contract terms documented? A: Short answer — not exhaustive. Publicly advertised examples (Aug 2025) that market “MSA/enterprise‑ready” hosting for open‑model workloads and publish SOC2/HIPAA or enterprise SLAs/MSA‑style terms: - RunPod — SOC2 reporting, HIPAA roadmap, says SLAs/terms can be tailored; compliance and legal pages (SLA/BAA/DPA via trust portal/contact). (<a href="https://www.runpod.io/compliance?utm_source=chatgpt.com">runpod.io</a>) - CoreWeave — published Terms of Service, Data‑Processing Addendum and SLOs; public MSA filings are available. (<a href="https://docs.coreweave.com/docs/policies/terms-of-service?utm_source=chatgpt.com">docs.coreweave.com</a>) - Hugging Face (Inference Endpoints / Enterprise) — advertises SOC2, enterprise SLAs/BAA/enterprise plans with dedicated SLA/contracting via sales. (<a href="https://huggingface.co/inference-endpoints/dedicated/enterprise?utm_source=chatgpt.com">huggingface.co</a>) Where to find the contract/SLA text: provider legal/compliance pages, published Terms/DPA/SLA docs and (for redlines/MSA negotiation) the providers’ enterprise sales or “trust” portals (links above). If you want, I can expand this list or fetch the exact indemnity/SLA clauses for any specific provider.</p>

[194] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which public analyses combining benchmark throughput (MLPerf/llm‑perf) and market pricing have published conservative bookend $/1k‑token ranges (lower bound based on throughput + spot/reserved GPU costs; upper bound based on closed‑API rates) for comparable model families, and what numeric lower/upper $/1k bounds do those reports show as of August 2025? A: Short answer — three public analyses that explicitly join benchmark throughput (server/MLPerf-style numbers) with market GPU/API pricing and publish conservative bookend $/1k‑token ranges (converted to $/1k here): - Ptolemay (LLM TCO, Aug 1, 2025): self‑host Falcon‑7B on H100 spot ≈ $0.013 / 1k (optimistic lower bound); closed‑API example GPT‑4o blended ≈ $6.25 / 1k (upper). (<a href="https://www.ptolemay.com/post/llm-total-cost-of-ownership">ptolemay.com</a>) - DeepResearch.wiki (April 18, 2025): reported emerging‑provider self‑host ≈ $30–$36 / 1M (≈ $0.03–$0.036 / 1k) and major‑cloud self‑host ≈ $88–$100 / 1M (≈ $0.088–$0.10 / 1k); OpenRouter API examples ≈ $0.21 / 1M (≈ $0.00021 / 1k). (reports show self‑host vs API bookends). (<a href="https://www.deepresearch.wiki/en/report/cost-comparison-api-vs-self-hosting-llms-e1xknxvzae0vyosa51ugbnin">deepresearch.wiki</a>) - CUDO Compute (real‑world GPU benchmarks, Jun 23, 2025): measured inference $/1M → H100 ≈ $0.026 / 1M (≈ $0.000026 / 1k) and A100 ≈ $0.191 / 1M (≈ $0.000191 / 1k) (benchmarks+public rates). (<a href="https://www.cudocompute.com/blog/real-world-gpu-benchmarks">cudocompute.com</a>) Notes: sources report different units (many use $/1M tokens); I converted to $/1k. Reports use different assumptions (spot vs on‑demand, model, batching, quantization), so ranges are not directly apples‑to‑apples — see cited posts for each method/assumption.</p>

[195] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which independent third‑party red‑team or audit reports of foundation models (for example by NIST, UK AISI, ART or equivalent) have been publicly released since January 2023, and for each report what vendor/model was audited, when was it published, and where is the report accessible? A: Brief list (public releases since Jan 2023): - NewsGuard — audit of OpenAI (ChatGPT‑4) &amp; Google Bard; published Aug 8, 2023; report on NewsGuard. (<a href="https://www.newsguardtech.com/special-reports/red-teaming-finds-openai-chatgpt-google-bard-still-spread-misinformation/">newsguardtech.com</a>) - Humane Intelligence (DEF CON GRT) — red‑team transparency report of 8 vendors (Anthropic, Cohere, Google, Hugging Face, Meta, NVIDIA, OpenAI, Scale, Stability.ai); released Aug 2023; full dataset/report on Humane Intelligence (GitHub/drive). (<a href="https://www.humane-intelligence.org/grt">humane-intelligence.org</a>) - Royal Society — summary note “Red teaming LLMs for resilience to scientific disinformation” (tested Meta’s Llama family in Oct 2023); published Oct 25, 2023; accessible on Royal Society site.

[196] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which public forensic audit reports produced by civic or third‑sector auditors since 2023 used open‑weight per‑record provenance manifests to run license/provenance checks or reproduce red‑team findings, and what were the audit conclusions and public sources? A: Short answer: I found one multi‑dataset civic/third‑sector forensic audit that clearly published per‑example provenance manifests and used them for license/provenance checks — the Data Provenance Initiative (MIT + collaborators, Oct 2023) — and its multimodal follow‑on (Dec 2024). Their work released per‑record provenance data and code, ran license attribution checks, and reported high rates of missing/miscategorized license info and heavy reliance on restrictively‑licensed sources; they published the paper, the Data Provenance Explorer, and the GitHub collection. I could not locate other public civic/third‑sector forensic audit reports since 2023 that explicitly state they used “open‑weight per‑record provenance manifests” to reproduce red‑team findings (noting absence isn’t proof of non‑existence). Sources: arXiv / paper + repo below — tell me any specific report/term you want me to search next.

[197] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Since 2023 which civic procurement consortia (city coalitions, NGOs or pooled public buyers) have publicly announced collective procurements that extracted vendor concessions on machine‑readable provenance, indemnities, or reduced pricing for AI models; list the consortia, the procurement outcomes, and public sources? A: Short answer — three public buyer consortia with documented, collective AI procurement outputs since 2023: 1) GovAI Coalition (U.S. cities) — produced a vendor “AI FactSheet” registry and a Vendor Agreement template that public buyers use to require vendor disclosures, audits, machine‑readable data portability and express indemnity language (used/shared by member agencies). (<a href="https://www.sanjoseca.gov/home/showpublisheddocument/118649/638774761928370000">sanjoseca.gov</a>) 2) EU “Public Buyers / Procurement of AI” community — published EU model contractual AI clauses (Sept/Oct 2023, updated 2024–2025) for public procurements that include data‑sharing, transparency/audit and liability/contractual clauses for buyers to require provenance and allocate liability. (<a href="https://public-buyers-community.ec.europa.eu/communities/procurement-ai/news/new-version-procurement-clauses-ai-available-supporting-responsible">public-buyers-community.ec.europa.eu</a>) 3) TXShare / Civic Marketplace (U.S. cooperative) — ran multi‑award cooperative AI solicitations (2025) giving public agencies access to vetted suppliers under pre‑negotiated cooperative contracts (intended to reduce procurement cost/time). (<a href="https://www.civicmarketplace.com/news/txshare-and-civic-marketplace-launch-nations-most-comprehensive-and-competitive-awarded-ai-contracts-for-local-government?utm_source=chatgpt.com">civicmarketplace.com</a>, <a href="https://www.withpavilion.com/solicitations/3ad0348f-3690-4a1f-b9e8-1148f0ad67ad/contracts/txshare_2025-018_kinetech-cloud-llc?utm_source=chatgpt.com">withpavilion.com</a>) Note: I did not find public announcements showing a single collective procurement that forced major model vendors (e.g., OpenAI/Anthropic/Google) to deliver a standardized, machine‑readable provenance feed or universal indemnity/discounts; publicly available evidence is primarily templates, registries, model clauses and cooperative contract awards rather than headline vendor concessions. If you want, I can search for any vendor‑specific press releases or executed contracts.</p>

[198] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which vendors or projects have published machine‑readable assistive‑technology test logs, alt‑text precision metrics, and multilingual z‑scores assembled as an ‘Accessibility &amp; Inclusion Compliance Pack’, and what numeric inclusion metrics were reported (with sources) as of August 2025? A: Short answer (as of Aug 10, 2025): I found no evidence that any vendor or project has published a single, packaged “Accessibility &amp; Inclusion Compliance Pack” that bundles (a) machine‑readable assistive‑technology (AT) test logs, (b) alt‑text precision metrics, and (c) multilingual z‑scores together under that name. Instead these three kinds of artifacts are published separately by different projects: - Machine‑readable AT test logs — W3C ARIA‑AT publishes JSON/test‑result exports and an automation results viewer. (<a href="https://w3c.github.io/test-results/wai-aria/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">w3c.github.io</a>, <a href="https://bocoup.github.io/aria-at-automation-results-viewer/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">bocoup.github.io</a>) - Alt‑text precision metrics — recent papers/projects publish numeric metrics (examples: AltGen reported cosine similarity 0.93 and BLEU ≈ 0.76; AltIcon / “Early Accessibility” reported CIDEr ≈ 134–138 and SPICE ≈ 22–23 for top systems). (<a href="https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2501.00113?utm_source=chatgpt.com">ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2504.13069v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>) - Multilingual z‑scores / standardized multilingual metrics — multilingual benchmarks (e.g., Global MMLU, GlotEval) publish standardized comparisons across languages, but not assembled into an accessibility “compliance pack.” (<a href="https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.919/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">aclanthology.org</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04155?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>) If you want, I can (a) fetch the specific JSON AT‑log files and link them, (b) extract the exact alt‑text metric tables (BLEU/CIDEr/SPICE) from the papers, and (c) look for any vendor-branded “compliance pack” language across corporate ACR/VPAT pages. Which would you prefer?</p>

[199] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which public studies or vendor evaluations have implemented a ‘Draft‑Finish Quality Preservation’ (DFQP) metric comparing open‑model drafts to closed‑model finishes (reporting embedding cosine similarity, safety‑fix rate at finish, and task‑accuracy delta) and what numeric preservation scores or break‑even routing thresholds did they report? A: Short answer: I could not find any public paper or vendor report that uses the exact label “Draft‑Finish Quality Preservation (DFQP)”. However several recent studies implement overlapping measurements (draft vs finish cosine/hidden‑state similarity, draft acceptance / verification (i.e., how many draft tokens survive the finisher), and task‑accuracy deltas)—but none report a single combined “preservation score” or an explicit break‑even routing threshold named DFQP. Representative papers and the numbers they report: - Draft &amp; Verify (Zhang et al., ACL/ArXiv 2024) — guarantees lossless verification (final = full model) and reports up to ~1.99× speedup / measured acceptance rates driving that speedup. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08168?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>) - Draft on the Fly (Metel et al., EMNLP 2024) — uses cosine similarity of hidden states (mean ACS ≈ 0.953) to prune layers and reports ~1.38–1.44× speedups (task‑accuracy nearly preserved). (<a href="https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2410.01028?utm_source=chatgpt.com">ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org</a>, <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.124/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">aclanthology.org</a>) - SVIP (dynamic draft length; Nov 2024) — reports draft acceptance rates ≈80–99% (LLaMA summaries ≈99%) and wall‑time gains (15–60% vs baselines), i.e., practical break‑even acceptance regions. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2411.18462?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>) Note: safety‑fix / “finish” correction rates are commonly evaluated in separate safety/durability papers (e.g., Qi et al. 2024) but not published as part of a unified DFQP metric. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2412.07097">arxiv.org</a>) If you want, I can extract the exact tables/figures and numeric acceptance/cosine‑threshold values from any one paper.</p>

[200] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which vendors have publicly agreed to or signed procurement annexes that require machine‑readable provenance manifests (C2PA/SLSA), quarterly anonymized invoice‑rate disclosure, a 60‑day price‑change notice with an annual increase cap, and SLA credits for unauthorized repricing; provide examples, vendor names, and public source links as of August 2025? A: Short answer (as of Aug 10, 2025): I could not find any public evidence that any vendor has publicly agreed to or posted a procurement annex that contains all four of those specific requirements together (machine‑readable provenance manifests (C2PA/SLSA), quarterly anonymized invoice‑rate disclosure, 60‑day price‑change notice with an annual increase cap, and SLA credits for unauthorized repricing). Private/redacted contracts may contain such terms, but I found no public, signed annexes covering the full set. Relevant public examples (partial matches): - C2PA / Content Credentials adoption (provenance): OpenAI, Microsoft, Adobe and others. (<a href="https://c2pa.org/openai-joins-c2pa-steering-committee/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">c2pa.org</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/content-credentials?utm_source=chatgpt.com">learn.microsoft.com</a>) - 60‑day notice + annual cap examples appear in published vendor terms (example: CloudRail; SunriseCloud). (<a href="https://cloudrail.com/terms/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">cloudrail.com</a>, <a href="https://www.sunrisecloud.com/en/subscription-agreement.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">sunrisecloud.com</a>) - GovAI / city procurement templates and vendor‑annex playbooks exist, but I found no public vendor appendices that bundle all four requirements. (<a href="https://www.withpavilion.com/associations/gov-ai?utm_source=chatgpt.com">withpavilion.com</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2411.04994v2?utm_source=chatgpt.com">arxiv.org</a>) If you want, I can (a) search specific vendors/contracts (e.g., Microsoft, Google, OpenAI, AWS, SAP) for any publicly posted annexes, or (b) pull and summarize particular procurement templates or redlines.</p>

[201] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Which vendors, projects, or community pilots have publicly deployed a ‘provenance canary’ protocol (cryptographically‑seeded synthetic records with public verification APIs or logs) and published verification logs or Rekor‑style attestations proving inclusion/absence in models; provide vendor/pilot names, dates, and links to the verification artifacts as of August 2025? A: Short answer — public, end‑to‑end deployments are scarce. Examples I found (name — date — artifact + status): - Alignment Research Center — Oct 13, 2022 — published public “canary” GUIDs (string you can seed into docs). (no Rekor/attestation log published by ARC). (<a href="https://www.alignment.org/canary/">alignment.org</a>) - Atlas (Intel Labs, prototype) — Feb 26, 2025 — paper and code describing a prototype that writes C2PA/attestations into a Rekor-style transparency log (research prototype; paper but no public Rekor inclusion proofs linked in the paper). (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19567">arxiv.org</a>) - Example artifact using Sigstore/Rekor: “kuhl_haus_canary” PyPI package — Apr 18, 2025 — PyPI page shows Sigstore transparency (Rekor) entry IDs for that release (demonstrates a canary‑named artifact with public Rekor entries). (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/kuhl-haus-canary/0.2.14/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">pypi.org</a>) Notes: many infra projects (Sigstore/Rekor, GitHub Artifact Attestations) enable such protocols, but as of Aug 10, 2025 there are few publicly documented instances that combine cryptographically seeded dataset/model canaries with published Rekor‑style inclusion/absence proofs. I can run live Rekor searches if you want exact log entries.</p>
