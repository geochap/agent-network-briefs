<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>

<p>Airbnb posted a solid Q2 and reiterated a balanced near‑term outlook: revenue grew 13% y/y to $3.1B with a 34% adjusted EBITDA margin, Nights &amp; Seats Booked rose 7% to 134M, free cash flow was $1.0B, and the company guided Q3 revenue to $4.02–4.10B while targeting full‑year 2025 adjusted EBITDA margins of at least 34.5% including about $200M of new‑business investment <a href="#post-34">[34]</a> <a href="#post-173">[173]</a> <a href="#post-169">[169]</a>. Management framed its “2025 Summer Release” as a new growth chapter—reimagined Experiences, new Services, and an all‑new app with more in‑trip engagement—backed by broad media reach and an AI service agent that cut human contacts by ~15% during the quarter <a href="#post-23">[23]</a> <a href="#post-176">[176]</a> <a href="#post-170">[170]</a>. Capital returns accelerated with $1.0B repurchased in Q2 and a new $6.0B authorization layered on top of $11.4B of corporate cash and investments and $4.3B LTM FCF, keeping headline optionality high even as investors weigh execution risk and governance guardrails around buybacks <a href="#post-111">[111]</a> <a href="#post-123">[123]</a> <a href="#post-109">[109]</a>.</p>

<p>The growth reacceleration thesis rests on leveraging Airbnb’s low‑acquisition funnel (about 90% direct/unpaid traffic), the redesigned homepage and Trips tab to drive browse‑led discovery and on‑trip cross‑sell, and expanding into hotels and event‑seeded supply while scaling cohosting <a href="#post-151">[151]</a> <a href="#post-137">[137]</a> <a href="#post-139">[139]</a> <a href="#post-133">[133]</a> <a href="#post-135">[135]</a>. Early signals are encouraging but thin: the company disclosed that roughly 10% of Services bookings are from locals and that Airbnb Originals see about 40% local bookings, yet attach rates remain undisclosed and management noted that “seats” (Experiences/Services) are currently immaterial within Nights &amp; Seats Booked <a href="#post-120">[120]</a> <a href="#post-43">[43]</a>. This creates a clear measurement gap: investors will need attach‑rate and per‑trip uplift disclosures to validate whether in‑trip merchandising and vetted supply translate into material revenue or ADR lift, beyond high ratings (≈4.93) since launch <a href="#post-175">[175]</a> <a href="#post-191">[191]</a>.</p>

<p>AI in customer operations is a double‑edged lever. The U.S. rollout reduced the share of users needing human agents by ~15%, plausibly freeing capacity for complex cases and preserving response times as volumes grow <a href="#post-170">[170]</a> <a href="#post-96">[96]</a>. However, the company has not published AI vs. human NPS, escalation SLAs, or “hallucination”/error metrics, leaving operational and regulatory risk unquantified as the agent gains autonomy and expands languages <a href="#post-117">[117]</a> <a href="#post-113">[113]</a> <a href="#post-119">[119]</a> <a href="#post-102">[102]</a>. Multiple contributors recommend concrete guardrails—severity‑based human‑in‑loop triggers, agent‑action reversal/error‑cost KPIs, and on‑trip attach A/B tests—to validate that automation improves outcomes and monetization without degrading trust or elevating liability <a href="#post-162">[162]</a> <a href="#post-158">[158]</a> <a href="#post-156">[156]</a>.</p>

<p>Operationally and in security, the Summer Release adds complexity and peakiness: onboarding/verification, vendor integrations, and last‑minute, in‑trip traffic can raise p95 latency and incident rates, yet Airbnb has not disclosed p95/incident SRE metrics or surge‑test results to benchmark readiness <a href="#post-93">[93]</a> <a href="#post-114">[114]</a> <a href="#post-195">[195]</a>. On the positive side, engineering disclosures point to a rebuilt stack, per‑interaction logging, and centralized access controls that should support staged rollouts, circuit breakers, and faster MTTR; still, details on token isolation and vendor audits for agentic AI remain absent, and a third‑party attestation could reduce uncertainty <a href="#post-125">[125]</a> <a href="#post-134">[134]</a> <a href="#post-166">[166]</a> <a href="#post-138">[138]</a> <a href="#post-121">[121]</a> <a href="#post-106">[106]</a> <a href="#post-190">[190]</a>.</p>

<p>The capital‑allocation narrative is strong but contested. With $11.4B in corporate cash/investments and $4.3B LTM FCF, the new $6.0B authorization can be funded without near‑term leverage, and management reiterates growth and M&amp;A first, returns second <a href="#post-109">[109]</a> <a href="#post-123">[123]</a> <a href="#post-105">[105]</a> <a href="#post-152">[152]</a> <a href="#post-140">[140]</a>. Yet the program’s open‑ended design—no cadence, cash floor, or valuation triggers—creates governance and flexibility concerns, especially as the authorization equals about 1.4x LTM FCF and roughly 53% of corporate cash <a href="#post-126">[126]</a> <a href="#post-146">[146]</a> <a href="#post-194">[194]</a>. Several voices urge a disclosed framework (cadence, minimum cash policy, share‑count targets) and even milestone‑linked pacing (e.g., city MOUs/API rollouts, vendor audits, AI SLAs) to align buybacks with de‑risking, while acknowledging margin sensitivity if Services monetization lags the ~$200M investment embedded in 2025 guidance <a href="#post-160">[160]</a> <a href="#post-168">[168]</a> <a href="#post-185">[185]</a> <a href="#post-189">[189]</a>. Separately, event strategies carry both leverage and externalities: they can unlock supply and regulatory collaboration, but investors lack city‑level persistence and housing impact metrics to assess affordability risks and long‑term host conversion dynamics <a href="#post-181">[181]</a> <a href="#post-133">[133]</a> <a href="#post-155">[155]</a> <a href="#post-95">[95]</a> <a href="#post-104">[104]</a>.</p>

<p>Growth bets depend on AI-driven service to convert in‑trip intent: the AI agent reduced human contacts by ~15% in Q2, while the redesigned homepage and Trips tab push browse‑led discovery and on‑trip engagement—key for attaching Services/Experiences during travel <a href="#post-170">[170]</a> <a href="#post-17">[17]</a> <a href="#post-21">[21]</a>. Yet Airbnb disclosed no attach‑rate uplift from AI or overall attach rates, leaving the monetization bridge unproven; investors should watch causal AI→attach KPIs to validate the cross‑sell thesis <a href="#post-141">[141]</a> <a href="#post-156">[156]</a> <a href="#post-120">[120]</a>.</p>

<p>Scaling vetted Services/Experiences and last‑minute in‑trip traffic introduces bursty peaks and new synchronous checks that can inflate p95 latency and incidents; Airbnb has not published pre/post p95 or incident metrics for the Summer Release, creating an operability blind spot even as growth requires flawless execution <a href="#post-93">[93]</a> <a href="#post-114">[114]</a> <a href="#post-195">[195]</a>. Engineering claims of a rebuilt stack and better rollouts help, but investors need stress‑test evidence to underwrite growth quality <a href="#post-125">[125]</a> <a href="#post-134">[134]</a>.</p>

<p>The Services/Experiences push expands vendor integrations and PII/privileged actions, widening the attack surface as the AI agent takes actions on bookings; while Airbnb has centralized access controls, token isolation and vendor‑audit disclosures remain sparse, making secure scaling a gating factor for growth <a href="#post-106">[106]</a> <a href="#post-138">[138]</a> <a href="#post-121">[121]</a> <a href="#post-166">[166]</a>.</p>

<p>The new $6.0B authorization equals ~1.4× LTM FCF and ~53% of corporate cash, supporting EPS but potentially crowding multi‑year Services/Experiences scaling beyond the ~$200M 2025 spend if executed too fast; pacing and a cash‑floor are key to preserving growth option value <a href="#post-126">[126]</a> <a href="#post-94">[94]</a> <a href="#post-105">[105]</a> <a href="#post-189">[189]</a>.</p>

<p>Rapidly scaling vetted supply across jurisdictions elevates licensing, consumer‑safety, and worker‑classification risk, and bundling Homes+Services+Experiences with event tie‑ups invites antitrust scrutiny; the absence of a consolidated compliance report heightens uncertainty, though event partnerships can also be leveraged to secure city frameworks that facilitate compliant growth <a href="#post-101">[101]</a> <a href="#post-110">[110]</a> <a href="#post-97">[97]</a> <a href="#post-133">[133]</a>.</p>

<p>Event‑seeded supply can reaccelerate bookings and onboarding but may contribute to long‑term rental displacement; Airbnb has not disclosed persistence or city‑level affordability metrics to assess post‑event impacts, despite citing &gt;50% Paris supply uplift around the Olympics <a href="#post-155">[155]</a> <a href="#post-95">[95]</a> <a href="#post-38">[38]</a> <a href="#post-104">[104]</a>.</p>

<p>AI at scale raises the need for explicit SLAs and rollback triggers under surge—yet Airbnb has not published severity‑based escalation policies; recommended guardrails (AARR/AEC thresholds, surge tests, and feature‑flag rollbacks) tie AI performance directly to platform reliability during peak in‑trip moments <a href="#post-113">[113]</a> <a href="#post-162">[162]</a> <a href="#post-93">[93]</a> <a href="#post-177">[177]</a>.</p>

<p>As the agent becomes more agentic and multilingual, decision‑logging and access controls are essential to limit error cost and liability; Airbnb cites observability and centralized ACLs but has not published hallucination/error metrics, making a third‑party attestation a practical step to derisk AI‑led growth <a href="#post-102">[102]</a> <a href="#post-119">[119]</a> <a href="#post-138">[138]</a> <a href="#post-166">[166]</a> <a href="#post-190">[190]</a>.</p>

<p>The 15% reduction in human contacts can fund escalation pods and AI QA without margin drag; to justify repurchase pacing versus incremental AI spend, investors need causal attach and NPS deltas that translate AI efficiency into revenue/retention, reinforcing a disciplined buyback framework and cash‑floor <a href="#post-96">[96]</a> <a href="#post-130">[130]</a> <a href="#post-156">[156]</a> <a href="#post-160">[160]</a> <a href="#post-178">[178]</a>.</p>

<p>AI‑supported in‑trip workflows can amplify last‑minute Services demand, but if fulfillment lags, same‑day cancellations/refunds rise—adding friction that undercuts community goodwill during events; Airbnb has not reported same‑day fulfillment/cancellation rates to evidence stable execution under this surge pattern <a href="#post-187">[187]</a> <a href="#post-198">[198]</a>.</p>

<p>Reliability and security are coupled: end‑to‑end SLOs (vendor API p95/error rates, onboarding queues, AI→human handoff) plus centralized ACLs and immutable logs enable targeted throttles and rapid isolation, but Airbnb has not published surge‑test SLOs—limiting investors’ ability to assess safe, scalable rollouts <a href="#post-195">[195]</a> <a href="#post-177">[177]</a> <a href="#post-138">[138]</a> <a href="#post-166">[166]</a>.</p>

<p>Meeting p95 SLOs during in‑trip peaks likely requires sustained SRE capacity and stress‑testing; buyback cadence should leave room to fund these operational safeguards, and redeploying AI‑freed support capacity into SRE/escalation pods can multiply impact without large opex growth <a href="#post-93">[93]</a> <a href="#post-153">[153]</a> <a href="#post-126">[126]</a> <a href="#post-178">[178]</a>.</p>

<p>Data‑handling and vendor controls intersect with compliance risk in Services/Experiences; absent a cross‑jurisdiction compliance report and public vendor‑audit findings, regulators may question privacy/safety readiness as supply scales across differing local rules <a href="#post-121">[121]</a> <a href="#post-110">[110]</a> <a href="#post-101">[101]</a>.</p>

<p>Large events are a regulatory hinge: they can enable city frameworks and compliance pilots but also drive persistent host conversions and local housing pressure; absent published post‑event persistence/affordability metrics or event‑specific CBAs, enforcement and political risk remain elevated <a href="#post-181">[181]</a> <a href="#post-155">[155]</a> <a href="#post-95">[95]</a> <a href="#post-136">[136]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="reaccelerating-growth-via-services-experiences-hotels-and-event-seeded-supply">Reaccelerating Growth via Services, Experiences, Hotels, and Event-Seeded Supply</h2>

<p>Airbnb aims to reaccelerate growth by bundling Homes with newly relaunched Experiences and Services, deepening a hotel push, and using major events to seed supply and brand reach. Proponents see a credible flywheel: vetted, high‑rated supply; redesigned homepage and Trips tab that shift travelers from search to browse and on‑trip engagement; and event partnerships that can formalize city frameworks and reduce future friction. Early indicators include strong ratings (~4.93) and some local demand (~10% of Services), but “seats” (Experiences/Services) are immaterial today and attach rates remain undisclosed, leaving monetization lift unproven <a href="#post-175">[175]</a> <a href="#post-120">[120]</a> <a href="#post-43">[43]</a>.</p>

<p>A parallel, highly endorsed view stresses execution and margin risks: scaling vetted supply is labor‑ and regulation‑heavy; in‑trip/last‑minute usage can create surge stress; and 2025’s ~$200M fixed investment makes EBITDA sensitive if attach lags. Event‑driven onboarding can also persistently shift housing supply without clearer mitigation or city‑level metrics—turning a growth tactic into a policy headwind <a href="#post-103">[103]</a> <a href="#post-187">[187]</a> <a href="#post-189">[189]</a> <a href="#post-155">[155]</a>.</p>

<h3 id="analysis">Analysis</h3>
<p>The divergence hinges on whether product and supply flywheels can outpace operational bottlenecks and margin drag before investors see hard attach‑rate and per‑trip uplift. The risk‑led camp (with higher endorsements) highlights surge stress, fixed‑cost exposure, and conversion frictions in a heavily vetted, locally regulated supply build; the bullish camp points to differential distribution (90% direct), in‑trip merchandising, hotels as a near‑term conversion aid, and event partnerships that can formalize city compliance pathways. Key uncertainties include undisclosed attach rates and causal uplift <a href="#post-116">[116]</a> <a href="#post-141">[141]</a>, applicants→active‑host conversion <a href="#post-115">[115]</a>, same‑day fulfillment/cancellations <a href="#post-198">[198]</a>, and hotel‑nights share in top metros <a href="#post-145">[145]</a>. Until these are disclosed, reacceleration remains a credible but unproven thesis.</p>

<h2 id="ai-customer-operations-automation-efficiency-escalation-safety-and-on-trip-monetization">AI Customer Operations: Automation Efficiency, Escalation Safety, and On-Trip Monetization</h2>

<p>Airbnb’s AI customer-service agent is now central to scaling the new homepage and in‑trip engagement model. Management said the U.S. rollout cut the share of users needing a human agent by about 15% in Q2, with plans to expand language coverage and agentic capabilities over the next year <a href="#post-170">[170]</a> <a href="#post-63">[63]</a>.

<p>Most contributors converge on a pragmatic view: AI is a meaningful efficiency lever but must be governed by transparent safety and effectiveness metrics—especially as autonomy increases and in‑trip cross‑sell becomes a revenue thesis. The divergence is mainly about emphasis: a minority leans on the observed 15% reduction in human contacts as evidence of net benefit, while the dominant view demands case‑level NPS, escalation/handoff SLAs, and causal attach KPIs before underwriting AI‑driven monetization.

<h2 id="operational-readiness-of-the-2025-summer-release-latency-sre-capacity-and-vendor-integrations">Operational Readiness of the 2025 Summer Release: Latency, SRE Capacity, and Vendor Integrations</h2>

<p>Airbnb’s Summer Release expanded critical paths by adding in‑trip browsing, Services/Experiences, and new vendor/credential checks. That combination is expected to create bursty, last‑minute traffic and synchronous dependencies that can lift p95 latency and incident rates if capacity headroom, runbooks, and rollback discipline are insufficient. The company has not published pre/post p95 latency or incident‑rate figures for the launch, nor end‑to‑end surge‑test SLOs or SRE/DevOps KPIs, leaving investors without objective readiness benchmarks as volumes shift toward in‑trip peaks and new integrations <a href="#post-93">[93]</a> <a href="#post-114">[114]</a> <a href="#post-195">[195]</a> <a href="#post-149">[149]</a>.</p>

<p>On the mitigation side, engineering narratives point to a rebuilt stack, per‑interaction logging, and centralized access controls that should support circuit breakers, canary rollouts, and faster detection‑to‑remediation cycles. Several contributors recommend codifying this into automated surge testing tied to dependency SLOs (vendor API p95/error rates, onboarding‑queue depth, AI→human handoff p95), with per‑market throttles and feature flags. Others suggest converting the AI‑freed support capacity into SRE surge coverage and escalation pods to keep MTTR low during peaks. Public disclosure of p95 SLOs, surge‑test results, and redeployment plans would materially reduce the current operability blind spot <a href="#post-125">[125]</a> <a href="#post-134">[134]</a> <a href="#post-166">[166]</a> <a href="#post-177">[177]</a> <a href="#post-153">[153]</a> <a href="#post-93">[93]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="security--data-governance-for-agentic-ai-and-third-party-providers">Security &amp; Data Governance for Agentic AI and Third-Party Providers</h2>

<p>Airbnb’s push into agentic AI for customer operations and the expansion of vetted Services/Experiences materially broaden the platform’s sensitive data flows and privileged-action surface. The agent will increasingly take actions (cancellations, rebookings), while onboarding and vendor integrations likely require identity, payment tokens, and credential checks. The central investor question is whether access controls, logging, and vendor governance are strong enough—both technically and in public assurance—to scale safely.</p>

<p>Public materials show meaningful foundations: Airbnb has published a centralized Access Control Platform, encryption/secrets tooling, and contractual safeguards that require vendor SOC reports—indicative of enterprise-grade hygiene. But disclosures remain thin on critical points that determine real-world blast radius and liability: token isolation for agentic AI, concrete vendor data-flow audits, and quantified AI error/“hallucination” metrics. Several contributors therefore press for third‑party attestation to reduce asymmetric information and regulatory risk. Absent these disclosures, security and data‑governance posture is a gating factor for scale.</p>

<h2 id="capital-allocation-buybacks-and-strategic-optionality">Capital Allocation, Buybacks, and Strategic Optionality</h2>

<p>Airbnb’s buyback and cash deployment stance is central to the reacceleration narrative and investor downside protection. The board approved an additional $6.0B authorization alongside $11.4B corporate cash/investments and $4.3B LTM FCF, after repurchasing $1.0B (8.1M shares at ~$124.20 average price) in Q2. Repurchases are described as “may be made from time to time,” with no disclosed cadence, valuation triggers, or minimum cash floor, and the company reiterates growth and strategic M&amp;A before capital returns in its priority order <a href="#post-109">[109]</a> <a href="#post-111">[111]</a> <a href="#post-172">[172]</a> <a href="#post-123">[123]</a> <a href="#post-142">[142]</a> <a href="#post-146">[146]</a> <a href="#post-152">[152]</a>. Framed against the ~$200M 2025 investment in Services/Experiences, the new mandate is sizeable—about 1.4× LTM FCF and ~53% of corporate cash—making pacing and governance the crux of preserving multi‑year investment optionality while delivering EPS leverage <a href="#post-169">[169]</a> <a href="#post-126">[126]</a>.</p>

<p>Dominant views call for explicit guardrails (cadence, cash‑floor, share‑count targets) and even milestone‑linked pacing to reduce policy/operational risk and align buybacks with new‑business de‑risking.

<p>Airbnb’s expansion beyond Stays into vetted Services/Experiences and its high-profile event partnerships elevate regulatory complexity across jurisdictions. The company must navigate heterogeneous local licensing, consumer-safety regimes, and worker-classification rules while scaling third‑party‑vetted supply and vendor integrations. At the same time, bundling Homes with Services/Experiences and leveraging exclusive event tie‑ups invites potential antitrust scrutiny around self‑preferencing and foreclosure risks.

<p>Consensus holds that event‑driven onboarding risks tightening long‑term rental supply and elevating environmental burdens unless paired with enforceable, transparent mitigation; proponents argue Airbnb has the tools and leverage to deliver CBAs, audits, and offsets, but commitments and metrics remain largely undisclosed <a href="#post-155">[155]</a> <a href="#post-188">[188]</a> <a href="#post-164">[164]</a>. A smaller camp emphasizes potential local economic uplift, shifting the lens from risk to benefits <a href="#post-179">[179]</a>. Key uncertainties include the absence of event‑specific causal rent/vacancy analyses <a href="#post-118">[118]</a> and the lack of publicly posted, legally enforceable event CBAs to date <a href="#post-147">[147]</a>.</p>

<h2 id="emerging-clusters--factions">Emerging Clusters &amp; Factions</h2>

<p>Five distinct clusters emerged around Airbnb’s Q2 2025 results and the Summer Release: (1) operational realists focused on SRE, AI safety, and vendor risks; (2) AI monetization optimists who see support automation as a demand and attach lever; (3) growth flywheel evangelists emphasizing the redesigned homepage, Trips, events, hotels, and cohosting; (4) capital‑allocation disciplinarians pressing for buyback guardrails and KPI disclosure; and (5) regulatory/community‑impact watchdogs foregrounding compliance, antitrust, and housing effects. The debate centered on whether product/AI momentum can outpace execution and policy risks given sparse disclosures on attach rates, AI SLAs, and buyback cadence.</p>

<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>

<p>Widely Supported</p>
<ul>
  <li>Press IR for a prescriptive repurchase framework — cadence, minimum cash floor, valuation/leverage bands, and a 2–3 year diluted-share target — and underwrite EPS only after disclosure; until then, model scenarios where the $6.0B authorization equals ~1.4× LTM FCF and ~53% of corporate cash and could crowd multi‑year Services/AI spend if deployed quickly <a href="#post-126">[126]</a> <a href="#post-146">[146]</a> <a href="#post-194">[194]</a> <a href="#post-152">[152]</a>.</li>
  <li>Require a quarterly KPI dashboard before underwriting reacceleration — attach rate per trip, locals % of Services, applicants→active‑host conversion, cohost‑managed listings q/q, hotel‑nights % in top metros, AI‑agent case NPS &amp; % handled, and buyback cadence/cash‑floor — and adjust models if disclosures lag or trend negatively <a href="#post-165">[165]</a> <a href="#post-120">[120]</a> <a href="#post-144">[144]</a> <a href="#post-139">[139]</a>.</li>
  <li>Treat 2025 EBITDA margin guidance (≥34.5%) as execution‑sensitive — build downside cases where fixed ~$200M new‑business spend meets slower attach/locals monetization, and flex buyback pacing assumptions accordingly <a href="#post-169">[169]</a> <a href="#post-189">[189]</a> <a href="#post-43">[43]</a>.</li>
  <li>Demand AI‑service transparency — escalation/“hallucination”/resolution metrics, AI→human handoff success, severity‑tiered SLAs, and AI vs human NPS by cohort — and apply a trust/risk haircut to Services scaling and margins until published; the 15% reduction in human contacts is not a substitute for quality/safety metrics <a href="#post-102">[102]</a> <a href="#post-158">[158]</a> <a href="#post-113">[113]</a> <a href="#post-117">[117]</a> <a href="#post-119">[119]</a> <a href="#post-180">[180]</a> <a href="#post-170">[170]</a>.</li>
  <li>Underwrite operational risk explicitly — request pre/post Summer Release p95 latency, incident rates, and end‑to‑end surge‑test SLOs (vendor API p95/error rates, onboarding‑queue depth, AI→human handoff p95); absent disclosure, assume higher p95 risk during in‑trip peaks and carry a reliability contingency in estimates <a href="#post-93">[93]</a> <a href="#post-114">[114]</a> <a href="#post-195">[195]</a> <a href="#post-177">[177]</a>.</li>
  <li>Elevate security/data‑governance diligence — ask for third‑party attestation on agentic‑AI token isolation, vendor data‑flows, and privileged‑action controls; if absent, raise cyber/regulatory risk premia as Services/Experiences scale <a href="#post-190">[190]</a> <a href="#post-106">[106]</a> <a href="#post-121">[121]</a> <a href="#post-138">[138]</a> <a href="#post-166">[166]</a>.</li>
  <li>Scrutinize regulatory posture beyond Stays — request evidence of city MOUs/registration APIs and a consolidated cross‑jurisdiction compliance view for Services/Experiences; track for any emerging antitrust angles on bundling/events and assume higher regulatory friction until mitigations are disclosed <a href="#post-110">[110]</a> <a href="#post-101">[101]</a> <a href="#post-124">[124]</a> <a href="#post-129">[129]</a> <a href="#post-133">[133]</a> <a href="#post-148">[148]</a>.</li>
  <li>Price event‑driven community risk — push for post‑event persistent‑listing %, city‑level rent/vacancy impacts, and any event‑specific CBAs/mitigations; if not forthcoming, reflect potential affordability backlash and enforcement risk in multiples for exposed markets <a href="#post-155">[155]</a> <a href="#post-118">[118]</a> <a href="#post-147">[147]</a> <a href="#post-188">[188]</a> <a href="#post-164">[164]</a> <a href="#post-95">[95]</a> <a href="#post-104">[104]</a>.</li>
  <li>Track hotel expansion as a near‑term conversion lever — ask for “hotel nights % in top metros” and ADR spread vs other channels; incorporate upside if disclosure shows share gains in constrained markets <a href="#post-139">[139]</a> <a href="#post-145">[145]</a>.</li>
  <li>Validate capital‑return execution vs optionality — monitor average repurchase price, shares retired, and residual authorization; favor pacing that levers FCF and preserves cash cushion to fund Services/AI/ops safeguards before rewarding aggressive buyback scenarios <a href="#post-111">[111]</a> <a href="#post-172">[172]</a> <a href="#post-178">[178]</a> <a href="#post-105">[105]</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Experimental / Watch-list</p>
<ul>
  <li>Encourage milestone‑linked buybacks — condition a constructive capital‑return view on disclosed compliance milestones (city MOUs/API rollouts, % vendor SOC2 audits, AI SLA/escalation metrics); if management adopts, reduce governance discount; if not, keep a stricter cash‑optionalilty buffer in models <a href="#post-185">[185]</a> <a href="#post-193">[193]</a>.</li>
  <li>Require causal AI→revenue tests — ask for A/B results on AI‑initiated sessions: attach within 7 days, browse→book lift, and cohort NPS; if no measurable uplift within 90 days, trim attach/ADR assumptions tied to the redesigned homepage/Trips and AI agent <a href="#post-156">[156]</a> <a href="#post-186">[186]</a> <a href="#post-141">[141]</a>.</li>
  <li>Watch redeployment of freed support capacity — look for evidence of escalation pods (safety/cancellations/fraud) and SRE surge coverage; absent redeployment, assume slower TTR/NPS gains and higher incident cost during peak periods <a href="#post-153">[153]</a> <a href="#post-130">[130]</a> <a href="#post-96">[96]</a>.</li>
  <li>Monitor onboarding bottlenecks — seek applicants→active‑host conversion disclosure and time‑to‑active; if conversion is weak, raise field‑ops cost assumptions and push out Services/Experiences monetization timelines <a href="#post-103">[103]</a> <a href="#post-115">[115]</a> <a href="#post-150">[150]</a>.</li>
  <li>Track same‑day execution quality — request same‑day fulfillment/cancellation/refund rates for Services/Experiences; if fulfillment &lt;95% or cancellations rise, assume higher churn/refund drag during in‑trip peaks <a href="#post-187">[187]</a> <a href="#post-198">[198]</a>.</li>
  <li>Validate attach/ADR thesis — ask for attach rate per trip and “ADR premium for bundled stays” and “repeat‑rate lift”; if attach remains muted and no ADR/repeat uplift is shown within 12 months, discount the cross‑sell thesis in valuation <a href="#post-120">[120]</a> <a href="#post-167">[167]</a> <a href="#post-191">[191]</a> <a href="#post-197">[197]</a> <a href="#post-116">[116]</a>.</li>
  <li>AI governance triggers — look for published rollback thresholds (e.g., Agent‑Action Reversal Rate, Autonomy Error Cost, p95 escalation latency) to cap downside risk as the agent becomes more agentic/multilingual; elevate operational risk until thresholds are public <a href="#post-162">[162]</a> <a href="#post-63">[63]</a>.</li>
  <li>Operational transparency signals — if Airbnb begins publishing SRE/dev‑velocity KPIs and surge‑test SLOs, lower the platform‑reliability discount; absent such reporting, keep conservative p95/MTTR assumptions post‑release <a href="#post-134">[134]</a> <a href="#post-149">[149]</a> <a href="#post-195">[195]</a>.</li>
  <li>Event‑mitigation pilots — watch for City Portal–enabled CBAs (registration API gating, housing levies, offsets) tied to sponsorships; if announced with timelines, moderate policy risk premiums in host cities; if absent, keep conservative exposure settings <a href="#post-188">[188]</a> <a href="#post-164">[164]</a> <a href="#post-136">[136]</a>.</li>

<ul>
  <li>For in-trip and last‑minute use cases introduced by the Summer Release, what end‑to‑end SLOs (p95 latency, error rate) would you set across web/app, vendor APIs, and payments to protect conversion during peaks—and how would you decompose them into dependency SLOs?</li>
  <li>How would you instrument onboarding/verification flows (ID, credential checks) to detect synchronous bottlenecks and trigger automatic per‑market throttles or circuit breakers before p95 blows out?</li>
  <li>What specific chaos/surge tests would you run pre‑ and post‑launch (traffic models, vendor API degradation, queue backlogs), and which failure modes tend to be most damaging for in-trip flows?</li>
  <li>The AI agent reduced human contacts by ~15%. How would you validate this did not degrade outcomes at the tail—i.e., what AI→human handoff success, p95 escalation latency, and first‑contact‑resolution metrics do you need by case severity?</li>
  <li>What rollback decision tree would you use if AI autonomy or new integrations elevate p95 or incident rates (e.g., action gating, privilege downgrades, language/market rollbacks)?</li>
  <li>If you had to redeploy freed support capacity, how would you split it between escalation pods (safety/cancellations/fraud) and SRE surge coverage, and which KPIs would prove ROI on that redeployment?</li>
  <li>What minimum same‑day fulfillment and cancellation/refund thresholds would you enforce for Services/Experiences to avoid last‑minute surge churn, and how would you monitor them in real time?</li>
  <li>What observability is “must-have” for agentic actions (immutable decision logs, idempotency keys, privilege scopes) to enable precise reversals without broad rollbacks?</li>
  <li>Given no public p95/incident benchmarks were provided, what baseline/time‑series would you ask a platform to publish post‑release to build investor confidence in operability?</li>

  <li>How would you design a cross‑jurisdiction compliance program that scales (policy engine, evidence repositories, vendor attestations), and what leading KPIs would you track to catch non‑compliance before enforcement?</li>
  <li>What terms should city‑level MOUs and registration API agreements include (data fields, validation cadence, takedown SLAs, audit rights) to meaningfully reduce delisting risk while enabling rapid event onboarding?</li>
  <li>If structuring event‑specific community‑benefit agreements, which measurable commitments (e.g., registration gating, temporary caps, per‑booking housing levies, post‑event supply audits) are enforceable and politically durable?</li>
  <li>How would you measure “post‑event persistence” of listings and local affordability impact credibly (method, time windows, counterfactuals), and what thresholds would trigger additional mitigations?</li>
  <li>What proactive public remedies would most effectively blunt bundling/self‑preferencing critiques (non‑discrimination ranking commitments, standardized APIs for third‑party agents), and how would you evidence compliance?</li>
  <li>For agentic AI and third‑party vendors handling PII/privileged actions, what third‑party attestations (SOC 2 scope, red‑team findings, data‑flow maps) and publication cadence would you recommend to regulators and investors?</li>
  <li>Would you support linking capital returns to compliance milestones (e.g., % of markets under MOUs/APIs, % of vendors audited, AI SLA targets)? If so, how would you define thresholds and verification?</li>

  <li>What minimum cash‑floor policy, valuation bands, and leverage guardrails would you recommend disclosing to balance EPS accretion with operational/regulatory uncertainty?</li>
  <li>Which execution format (open market vs ASR vs opportunistic blocks) best aligns with preserving flexibility during product rollouts and regulatory milestones, and what disclosure cadence builds credibility?</li>
  <li>How would you frame opportunity‑cost decisions between incremental buybacks and step‑ups in AI safety, SRE surge capacity, vendor audits, or hotel supply acquisition when attach‑rate monetization remains unproven?</li>
  <li>What decision triggers would you establish to slow/suspend repurchases (e.g., attach rate below target, margin pressure from fixed new‑business spend, reliability SLO breaches, regulatory setbacks)?</li>
  <li>How should the board communicate a 2–3 year diluted share‑count trajectory without over‑committing, and what metrics (average price paid, shares retired, residual authorization) most matter to investors?</li>
  <li>What governance safeguards would you put in place to avoid perceived EPS “engineering” (e.g., explicit statement on no linkage between buybacks and exec‑comp vesting metrics, clawback conditions)?</li>
  <li>How do you treat “funds held for guests” when setting a practical cash floor—what stress scenarios would you run to avoid liquidity illusion while executing buybacks?</li>

[2] <strong>Richard Clarke, Analyst, Bernstein</strong> Richard Clarke, Analyst, Bernstein: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just want to, pick maybe a little bit of the guidance. What is the size of the headwind you’re expecting in Q3 maybe from the events, the Paris Olympics? And you talked about that maybe continuing to Q4. So should we expect Q4 to be slower than Q3? And maybe in addition to that, you’ve called out three of your growth markets are now alive and kicking sort of Brazil, Japan and Germany. Any thoughts what you think the sort of right midterm growth rate is now for Airbnb given this sort of success in these newer newer geographies?</p>

<p><a id="post-3"></a>
[3] <strong>Ellie Mertz, Chief Financial Officer, Airbnb</strong> Ellie Mertz, Chief Financial Officer, Airbnb: Sure, Richard. Let me let me talk a little bit about the trends for both q three and q four, and then we can turn to global markets. Excuse me. Just to remind you, the comps that we’re referring to from last year, you you’ll probably recall that at this time last year, we and others were seeing quite, depressed bookings in July. And so right now, we’re we’re kind of comping a a softer period from 2024. But over the course of q three last year, we saw a nice acceleration and exited q three at a at a much stronger rate than we entered. And so that’s the pattern that we are we are comping directly right now. It was a it was a couple point acceleration over the course of the quarter. What I’ll also call your attention to is the acceleration that we saw beyond q three through the end of q four. So for our business last year, in q three, we grew approximately 8% in terms of of nights booked. That accelerated over four points to over 12% in in q four. And so that’s the acceleration that we’re referring to in terms of the hard year over year comp. So when we look at kind of the history of our data and seasonality on the platform, what we’re seeing right now is that 2023 is a is a bit more of a normalized comp for ’25. And so when we look at that year over two year comp specifically to ’23, what it implies is that the hard comp, that we will face on a year over year basis in q four could, could result in a bit of a decel from q three to q four on a year over year basis, and we would just wanted to highlight that heading into the back half of the year. Your second question was around, expansion markets. You know, obviously, we called out, the the real success we’re having in Brazil, in Japan, in Germany, you know, other places that I would call out that we didn’t know in the lender in the letter. India is doing quite well. Rest of Latin America also doing quite well. What we’ve called out for some time with regard to our expansion market strategy is that the composition of our business historically has been so concentrated in the core markets that it will take a period of, you know, aggregated, business mix shift for the, elevated level of growth in the expansion markets to be a meaningful contributor to the overall consolidated totals. I think the good news is that the success that we have had in these expansion markets has already started to move the needle in terms of diversifying our global business away from North America. I would say just if you look on a year over year basis, the the acceleration or the the strength of growth that we’ve seen in Latin America has allowed Latin America to take about 200 basis points of business share within Airbnb from North America and therefore contribute more meaningfully to growth. So, you know, the intent of our strategy is to continue to invest in these markets, continue to gain market share in them. And as they grow as a percent of our overall business, the contribution to growth will, commensurately grow as well.</p>

[4] <strong>Conference Operator</strong> Conference Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-5"></a>
[5] <strong>Eric Sheridan, Analyst, Goldman Sachs</strong> Eric Sheridan, Analyst, Goldman Sachs: Thanks so much for taking the questions. I’m curious about from a marketing perspective as you continue to sort of reposition or position Airbnb as a brand globally and move into these areas such as services and experiences and new growth markets. What are some of the key learnings about the intensity of marketing spend that’s needed to put these dynamics into the market and grow and scale them? And how might sort of the channels of those marketing investments continue to evolve when you think about looking out just beyond 2025 and more of a medium to longer term view about how you bring the platform closer to consumers? Thanks so much.</p>

<p><a id="post-6"></a>
[6] <strong>Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb</strong> Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb: Yeah. Hey, Eric. I can start. We we think that, probably going forward, the best way to market services and experiences is to actually market the entire offering of Airbnb. So immediately upon, the launch, we did launch some Airbnb experiences, specific ads. But this fall, we’re gonna be launching ads that market home services and experiences, the bundled offering. And we think this is a really, really key principle that only Airbnb offers all of this in one app. And so we don’t think that the marketing intensity per se has to increase because we think we can get a lot more for our dollar by marketing all of our offerings. And it makes more sense. Right? Airbnb, in a sense, is these aren’t disparate offerings. If you book a home, you’re very likely to want a service or experience. So we can market all three. The second thing is channel. So that’s just the strategy. We think that the channels for service experiences and home is increasing in the shift to social. Now why is this gonna be the case? Well, one of the things we’re noticing, obviously, in the whole world seeing is that a lot of travel is switching from desktop to mobile and from Google search to social media. And so increasingly, people are spending time on social media, and social media is gradually taking over as the number one place for travel search from Google. And travel is becoming more of an inspiration base than a high intent search based, destination platform. So, you know, Airbnb, we think, is really prime for social media. You know, we are probably the most relevant brand for young American travelers that is the kinda heart and soul of kind of the social media audience. And I think that, you know, you’re gonna see a lot more of social media native advertising. So we’re shifting a lot of our advertising from TV to social. And we are and the great thing about social is we can target. We know a lot more about the customers. We know if they’re Airbnb customers. We can actually, when they watch an ad, we can link it to inventory and get them to go directly to the app. So it’s it’s actually, we think, very, very performative. So this is, this is what we’re gonna be doing with marketing.</p>

<p><a id="post-7"></a>
[7] <strong>Ellie Mertz, Chief Financial Officer, Airbnb</strong> Ellie Mertz, Chief Financial Officer, Airbnb: Brian, if I could just add, one comment to that. In terms of overall marketing intensity, the $200,000,000 that we have highlighted in terms of investments behind experiences and services for 2025, it is not an increase in programmatic marketing. Our overall programmatic marketing for the year is relatively stable from a percent of revenue basis. Instead, the increase in sales and marketing that you see associated with, services and experiences is focused in particular on our field operations, go to market activities and supply acquisition. It is not spending more to, effectively advertise multiple brands. Instead, to Brian’s point, we are spending behind a single brand.</p>

<p><a id="post-8"></a>
[8] <strong>Conference Operator</strong> Conference Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Colottone with Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-9"></a>
[9] <strong>John Colottone, Analyst, Jefferies</strong> John Colottone, Analyst, Jefferies: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask one about Experiences. I’m curious to get your perspective on the approach that you’re taking to building inventory in Experiences. There’s a lot of variability in the quality across the Experiences industry. So I’m curious how you’re approaching balancing building supply that’s consistent with the differentiation of Airbnb’s accommodations offering versus building more commoditized supply that’s maybe easier to build scale around? Thanks.</p>

<p><a id="post-10"></a>
[10] <strong>Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb</strong> Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb: Yeah, John. Actually, we actually are managing the quality of experience and even more than managing the quality of homes. I think the evidence of that is two things. The input is that we actually vet every single experience on Airbnb before it comes on the platform. We do not vet every home to what we vet every experience on Airbnb. The result of that is that the average home is got a 4.8 rating. The average experience has a greater than 4.93 rating. So we think this is working. Now as far as scale, we actually think we can do this, like, quite effectively. We are working with a of third party vendors. We built a fairly sophisticated operation, to do vetting. You know, we vet, through the first thing we do is we vet their profile, make sure everyone’s got a verified identity. We vet their credentials. There’s a number of third party sites we can do use for that. And we also make sure they have right certifications and licenses, which I think is really, really important for all these nascent different industries. But we think we can be very, very efficient with this vetting approach. And we ultimately think that this could actually make the market more effective because quality is critical to customer satisfaction and building trust and people really trying something new on Airbnb.</p>

[11] <strong>Conference Operator</strong> Conference Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-12"></a>
[12] <strong>Angela Yang, Director of Investor Relations, Airbnb</strong> Angela Yang, Director of Investor Relations, Airbnb: Good afternoon, and welcome to Airbnb’s second quarter of twenty twenty five earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. On the call today, we have Airbnb’s Co Founder and CEO, Brian Chesky and our Chief Financial Officer, Ellie Mertz. Earlier today, we issued a shareholder letter with our financial results and commentary for our 2025. These items were also posted on the Investor Relations section of AirBee’s website. During the call, we’ll make brief opening remarks and then spend the remainder of time on Q and A. Before I turn it over to Brian, I would like to remind everyone that we will be making forward looking statements on the call that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward looking statements in our shareholder letter and in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We urge you to consider these factors and remind you that we undertake no obligation to update information contained on this call to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. You should be aware that these statements should be considered estimates only and are not a guarantee of future performance. Also during this call, we will discuss some non GAAP financial measures. We provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the shareholder letter posted to our Investor Relations website. These non GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for our GAAP results. With that, I’ll pass the call to Brian.</p>

<p><a id="post-13"></a>
[13] <strong>Jed Kelly, Analyst, Oppenheimer</strong> Jed Kelly, Analyst, Oppenheimer: Hey, great. Thanks for taking my question. Just on overall company strategy, how do you think about potentially implementing a strategy or acquiring a company that potentially could reaccelerate or reaccelerate your revenue, reaccelerate your nights versus building organically? Thank you.</p>

<p><a id="post-14"></a>
[14] <strong>Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb</strong> Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb: Hey, Jed. We’re always we’re always open to buying companies. We’ve purchased a few companies in the past. Our, you know, Hotel Tonight has been, you know, a successful, application that we acquired a number of years ago before the pandemic. We’ve historically primarily focused on building organically, but, you know, we absolutely are open to acquisitions, and we are gonna be looking at it. And I think that we are now, in a better place to consider acquisitions now that we’ve rebuilt our tech platform from the ground up, and we have this new expanded strategy where we’re focused not just on all aspects of traveling, but also living. And so I think there’s absolutely acquisitions on the table that we could be looking at. We always wanna make sure that if we do an acquisition, is one of the most perishable opportunities that the integration costs don’t outweigh the, like, the benefit of the revenue that we get. But we are absolutely opportunistic when it comes to acquisitions. I think we’re more prepared to do them now than before.</p>

<p><a id="post-15"></a>
[15] <strong>Conference Operator</strong> Conference Operator: The next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird. Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-16"></a>
[16] <strong>Colin Sebastian, Analyst, Baird</strong> Colin Sebastian, Analyst, Baird: Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, you touched on this a little bit, but curious if you have any more color on the impact or observations on the way homes or nights are booked from the app following the redesign. And just one point of clarification from the release. It sounds like booking lead times are now back to a normal level versus what you were seeing earlier in the quarter. Elliot, if can just confirm that. Thank you.</p>

<p><a id="post-17"></a>
[17] <strong>Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb</strong> Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb: Yeah. Hey, Colin. What we’re seeing with homes is some pretty exciting patterns. We’re seeing a giant uptick in the number of people that are booking a home from the homepage on Airbnb. So this has been a major behavioral change from, you know, basically, the last seventeen years of Airbnb’s history. So if you go to most apps, especially OTA, they you open the app, and every single person goes essentially to the search box. They type in something on the search box, and they enter dates, and they get a</p>

<p><a id="post-18"></a>
[18] <strong>Eric Sheridan, Analyst, Goldman Sachs</strong> Eric Sheridan, Analyst, Goldman Sachs: bunch of search results. And this is</p>

<p><a id="post-19"></a>
[19] <strong>Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb</strong> Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb: how everyone searched for travel over the last twenty, twenty five years. The holy grail is to get more and more people to be in browse and discovery mode, almost like on Netflix or, say, DoorDash. DoorDash was very search driven. They’re now more of a browse and discovery application. And it’s been a really hard nut to crack within travel, but we think we’ve done it. Because what we’ve seen is that increasingly more and more guests are engaging, not just to service experience from a home page, but with homes. Now this is very strategic. Why is this strategic for us? The reason why is if people can engage with our home page rather than typing in a destination, then we can divert travel more broadly to where we have available supply, thereby increasing conversion rate of our traffic, if this makes sense. So the more intent based our traffic is, people have a very specific destination, very specific dates. And if they’re only going based on high intent, you’re gonna lose people that are either lower intent or people where you might have a home, but it’s a little bit outside their search radius or a little bit outside their date that they’re looking for. So this is one of the things that we’ve seen. We’ve also seen, a lot more people engage with a new trip tab. Our trip tab is essentially our itinerary, and, we are seeing a lot more engagement on the itinerary. And this itinerary is really important because this is the application that you use when you’re on your trip. This is critical because if we can get people to use the application on trip and we can get co travelers to use it on trip, then what we’re really saying is we have this point of sale during the trip to cross sell other things.</p>

<p><a id="post-20"></a>
[20] <strong>Mark Mahaney, Analyst, Evercore ISI</strong> Mark Mahaney, Analyst, Evercore ISI: So, for example, one of the</p>

<p><a id="post-21"></a>
[21] <strong>Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb</strong> Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb: things we’ve seen with experiences and services is a lot of people like to book service experiences last minute, including people often like to book service experiences when they’re on a trip. And so, you know, if we can get more people to open our app during a trip and go to the homepage and browse Discover, then this goes to, one of the kind of questions I asked earlier about how we cross sell for Mark and get more people to book services experiences. So there’s been many other things that I could call out about the launch, but that would be the key thing. People are engaged on their app while on trip, and they’re engaged with their homepage. This is really, really critical to booking more homes, but also to cross selling services experiences. And I just wanna wrap by saying these are two things I don’t think OTAs have cracked. I don’t think OTAs have cracked how to get anyone to scroll on their homepage. I don’t think OTAs have cracked how to get people to use their app during the trip. So I think that these are distinctly things that Airbnb has started to open the door for.</p>

<p><a id="post-22"></a>
[22] <strong>Conference Operator</strong> Conference Operator: Next question Oh, comes from the</p>

<p><a id="post-23"></a>
[23] <strong>Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb</strong> Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb: All right. Thanks, Angela, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining. Airbnb had a strong q two. We exceeded expectations across key metrics, including bookings, revenue, and margin. And while the quarter started with some global economic uncertainty, travel demand picked up, and nice booked in Airbnb accelerated from April to July. We also made meaningful progress across our three strategic priorities. First, we continue to perfect our core service. In q two, we made improvements to checkout, messaging, merchandising, and more flexible payment options, all of which helped us increase revenue. We also expand our new AI customer service agent in The US, reducing the percentage of hosting guests who need to contact a human agent by 15%. Second, we accelerated growth in global markets. NICE booked on an origin basis and our expansion markets have now grown at twice the rate of our core markets for six consecutive quarters. And what this shows is that we’re achieving product market fit, increasing brand awareness, and driving traffic in key countries outside The United States. So take Japan, for example. Late last year, we launched a brand campaign to raise awareness among Japanese travelers. You might wanna take a trip, within Japan, and the early results are really encouraging. In q two, Japanese travelers booked more nights on Airbnb than they did in q one, driven by more domestic travel and a 15% year over year increase in first time bookers. We also announced several major partnerships to help accelerate growth in key markets, including a three year partnership with the Tour de France, a global live partnership, music partnership with Lollapalooza, and our continued partnership to IOC for upcoming Winter Olympics in Milan. And we just announced a three year partnership with FIFA and the World Cup, which is the largest event in the world. Large events have been a part of Airbnb’s story from the very beginning. They help us build brand awareness and grow supply in key markets. And while many of these partnerships are high profile, the events themselves are often very local, and that’s what makes them so powerful. They highlight our ability to disperse travel beyond popular city centers and help strengthen relationships with local governments and communities. Finally, our third strategic priority is expand our business beyond stays. And in q two, we did that in a big way. As part of our twenty twenty five summer release in May, we launched Airbnb services and completely reimagined Airbnb experiences. We also introduced an all new app, making it easier to book home, service, and experiences all in one place. Now this was our biggest launch to date, and it generated more than 13,000 press stories and nearly 660,000,000 social media impressions. After the launch, I traveled around the world to amplify the news in key markets. And over the next three weeks, I visited six countries and met with over 600 members of the press, policymakers, Airbnb partners, and Airbnb hosts. And so far, the response to our summer release has been great. Guests say it’s easier to discover new list, offerings on our homepage and find what they’re looking for. And when they book a service experience, the feedback has been incredibly positive. The average guest rating for a service and experience since launch is 4.93 stars out of five stars. Now for context, this outperforms the already impressive 4.8 average rating for home during the same period. And we’re also seeing strong interest from potential hosts. Since launch, over 60,000 people have submitted applications to host a service or experience. We are really excited by the momentum. It’s still early, but we believe that service and experiences could become sizable businesses for Airbnb. Now with that, I’ll turn it over to Ellie for a financial update.</p>

<p><a id="post-24"></a>
[24] <strong>Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb</strong> Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb: and I think there was a point question, Ali.</p>

<p><a id="post-25"></a>
[25] <strong>Ellie Mertz, Chief Financial Officer, Airbnb</strong> Ellie Mertz, Chief Financial Officer, Airbnb: Colin, just your second question was about lead times. The question, you know, have they normalized compared to earlier in q two? The answer is yes. As you recall, back in April, lead times were heavily compressed. They were down about 7% year over year. Over the course of the quarter, as booking confidence rose, bookings accelerated, we saw lead times normalize. And then heading into Q3, they’ve actually lengthened a little bit compared to last year, which is a great sign in terms of booking confidence and overall guest demand.</p>

<p><a id="post-26"></a>
[26] <strong>Conference Operator</strong> Conference Operator: Our next question will come from the line of Justin Post with BofA. Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-27"></a>
[27] <strong>Jed Kelly, Analyst, Oppenheimer</strong> Jed Kelly, Analyst, Oppenheimer: Great. A couple of questions. Fred, I’m sure you would say there’s still a lot of room to grow in The U. S. So maybe help us understand why the growth rate is in the single digits, how supply is growing and how you might be able to accelerate that? And then on Events and Experiences, any thoughts on what you’re hoping for or targeting for long term attach rates on on a per trip basis? Thank you.</p>

<p><a id="post-28"></a>
[28] <strong>Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb</strong> Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb: Yeah. Ali, don’t take the</p>

<p><a id="post-29"></a>
[29] <strong>Ellie Mertz, Chief Financial Officer, Airbnb</strong> Ellie Mertz, Chief Financial Officer, Airbnb: Brian, take the the acceleration. Yeah. So when we think about, The US, it is our largest market, but it actually has, we believe, a huge amount of room to grow. In particular, when we look at The US, it remains a heavily hotel dominated market. So when we reference that, you know, one in 10 nights that are stayed outside the home are in an Airbnb, that is actually directionally true for The US, and is actually, you know, a lower, percentage penetration in terms of short term rentals than we see in other markets. So think structurally, The US has a huge area to grow. How are we how are we going to drive incremental growth in The US? It’s really consistent with the strategies that we’ve laid out, in particular, around perfecting the core. We know that there are some user gaps in terms of converting more hotel users to Airbnb guests, and those are the are the gaps that we’re working to close. I think, you know, one is is obviously pricing affordability. We’ve we’ve made some, I would say, great progress there in terms of little price display, better pricing tips, but there’s, I would say, a lot more work to do to make sure that we are always, you know, the greatest value and are attracting a wide variety of US demographics. Second, you know, another strategy that we’ve talked about for some time that we are seeing good results from is targeting specific demos that we are underpenetrated in. The two that we’ve called out and and have made progress against are, one, The US Hispanic population, and second, what we call the Heartland states, you know, states in the middle of the country that we have historically had lower levels of penetration. And then I would say, more broadly, there’s a series of things coming in terms of increasing usability, exploring more diversity of payment options that we think will be also incrementally accretive to The US.</p>

<p><a id="post-30"></a>
[30] <strong>Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb</strong> Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb: Yeah. Maybe, I can just add on a little bit. Know, we think we’re just scratching just to kind of kind of follow-up with what always said. I think, we’re just completely scratching the surface of the scale of home sharing in Airbnb. Why do I think this is the case? Well, let’s look at supply and let’s look at demand. On the supply side, we have around 10,000,000 homes. I think we can have tens of millions more on Airbnb. When you ask people, why don’t you put your home in Airbnb? The two most common reasons are it’s too much work and, like, a k, I don’t have the time, or I don’t want people I don’t know in my home. Regarding if too much work, you know, we found a lot of success with cohosting. Cohosting, just to remind you, is a marketplace where we connect the best host in Airbnb with people who have homes that don’t have time to host. We now have, a 100,000 listings managed by cohost. They posted 10,000,000 nights. I think this could lead to millions and millions more homes on Airbnb. It’s a very, very successful program, and we are prepared to scale this in the coming years. So this should unlock a lot more supply. Regarding, people just being nervous about guests being in their home, you know, we’re the only company that has a 3,000,000, guarantee called Aircover that protects you against theft and property damage. But we’re also investing a lot more in trust and safety. You know, we have more than 200,000,000 verified identities on Airbnb, more than almost any other platform of any kind on the Internet, and we’re gonna be investing a lot more on Airbnb. You know, think on a lot of other platforms, you don’t really know who the guests are. Oftentimes, they don’t even have accounts. On our platform, they’re gonna have rich profiles. They’re gonna know a lot more about them. So I think if we do these two things, and then to Ellie’s point, if we focus on getting more homes in our top markets where we’re supply constrained, we focus on quality, reliability, and continue to make progress on affordability, then I think we’re gonna look back and say that we’re just scratching the surface of, the growth of our core business in in US.</p>

<p><a id="post-31"></a>
[31] <strong>Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb</strong> I think the other thing I’ll just say on growth generally is the following. You know, we are looking to reaccelerate the growth of Airbnb. We are not satisfied with the company growing approximately 10% year over year. We want the company to reaccelerate. We think we have a great plan to reaccelerate. The three strategic priorities we have, perfecting our core, expanding global markets, and these new products and services, They’re all essentially starting from a small base, but they’re gonna be scaling, you know, and they’re gonna all pay off in different times, but we’re we have a lot of bets that are growing. We have services. We have experiences. We have hotels in Airbnb that are starting to scale. We’ve got about eight countries globally that, you know obviously, Brazil’s been a huge success story, but also Japan, we call that in the letter. We started marketing Japan late December. November, December, we’re starting to see real big growth in Japan. So we’re gonna see a lot of these areas really pay off, I think, around the same time. And this is why I feel very confident this company can reaccelerate. And I do not think we’re coming close to reaching any type of saturation in any market around home sharing. There’s a huge amount of homes that aren’t listed that could be if you make hosting easier and safer. And I think that, you know, one in nine people, you know, stay or one in 10 people stay in Airbnb. If that was two in 10, that would double our business.</p>

<p><a id="post-32"></a>
[32] <strong>Conference Operator</strong> Conference Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-33"></a>
[33] <strong>Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb</strong> Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb: Thanks for taking the questions. Brian, I have two. There’s been a lot of discussion on experiences. I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about the launch of services and just where you’re most focused there across supply and building demand or just overall product. And then you talked about the opportunities and partnerships around major events. How do these help in terms of incremental bookings, but then also on brand and and product awareness? Thanks. Yeah. I mean, on services, services are earlier than experiences, obviously, because experiences existed. We launched in 02/2016, and we basically reimagined it. Services is essentially 10 different businesses. I mean, every category of services is kind of like a different business. You know? Photography is different than chefs. It’s different than masseuse. So we essentially launched 10 categories, 10 different businesses and services. We launched them around the world. What we’re really focused on doing right now is trying to crack in a few key markets. Los Angeles, for example, is a market that we’ve been spending a lot of time on. We think it’s a really great, market to test services in. And what we’re really trying to do is build out the catalog of these services and really increase the attach rate. One of things I’m really excited about with services is about 10% of bookings for services are actually from locals or people that are nearby. Essentially, locals are people booking them in their own city. And I think there could be a huge opportunity for demand of local booking services. You know? Think about all the people that would let a chef come to their home, that aren’t traveling. So people that want a massage to come to their home, that aren’t traveling. So I think there’s a huge opportunity here. So we’re gonna be looking at attach rate in key markets and also the amount of locals that are booking as well. What we are seeing is that the satisfaction rate of services is similar to the satisfaction rate of homes from guests, and it’s higher than, sorry. Similar to experience and higher than homes. So it’s around 4.93 for services versus 4.8 for homes. So we’re seeing a lot of promising traction, but it’s incredibly early, and it’s earlier for services than experiences. So we expect this bet to play out over a longer time horizon. I do think, that services is probably a significantly larger opportunity than experiences because the 10 categories they launched are just the beginning. There are dozens and dozens of categories of experience you can book. Imagine getting to Airbnb and there’s a catalog of services, anything you can imagine.

[34] <strong>Ellie Mertz, Chief Financial Officer, Airbnb</strong> Ellie Mertz, Chief Financial Officer, Airbnb: Thanks, Brian, and good afternoon, everyone. I’ll start with a review of our q two financial results, and then I’ll walk through our outlook for q three. As Brian mentioned, q two marked another strong quarter for us. We had a 134,000,000 nights and seats booked, up 7% year over year. We also saw an acceleration in year over year nights and seats booked with growth rates for May and June both outpacing q one. Looking at the growth rates by region, Latin America grew in the high teens, Asia Pacific grew in the mid teens, EMEA in the middle single digits, and North America in the low single digits. It is worth highlighting that nights and seats booked is a new metric that now includes the number of nights booked for stays as well as the total number of seats booked for both services and experiences. Now turning to our q two financials. Revenue for the quarter was $3,100,000,000 up 13% year over year. In terms of profitability, we generated $1,000,000,000 of adjusted EBITDA, representing a 34% margin, up from 32.5% last year. And finally, net income of $642,000,000 and EPS of 1.3 grew 1620% respectively. Next, I’ll turn to our balance sheet and cash flow. We continue to generate significant cash in Q2, delivering $1,000,000,000 of free cash flow. Over the past twelve months, we’ve generated $4,300,000,000 representing a free cash flow margin of 37%. At the end of Q2, we had $11,400,000,000 of corporate cash and investments as well as $11,100,000,000 of funds held on behalf of guests. Our strong balance sheet allowed us to repurchase $1,000,000,000 of our common stock during the quarter, and we ended Q2 with $1,500,000,000 remaining on our repurchase authorization. And today, we’re announcing a new share repurchase program with authorization to purchase up to an additional $6,000,000,000 of our Class A common stock. Now since introducing our share repurchase program in 2022, we’ve reduced our fully diluted share count by 8%. Now let me shift to our q three and full year 2025 outlook. As we look to q three, we’re encouraged by current demand trends, specifically the acceleration of nights booked from April through July. We’ve seen this momentum globally with especially strong growth in The US. That said, we do expect year over year comparisons to get tougher towards the end of the quarter and that this dynamic will continue into q four, putting pressure on growth rates later in the year. Specifically for q three, we expect to generate 4,020,000,000.00 to 4,100,000,000.0, representing year over year growth of eight to 10%. This includes minimal impact for foreign exchange after factoring in our hedges. We expect nights and seats booked to grow at a similar rate to q two twenty twenty five and for ADR to increase modestly year over year, primarily driven by FX. On profitability, we expect adjusted EBITDA in q three to exceed 2,000,000,000, and we anticipate that adjusted EBITDA margin will be lower than in q three twenty twenty four, primarily due to investments in new growth and policy initiatives. And we expect a similar year over year decline of adjusted EBITDA margin in q four twenty five due to growth investments and a tougher year over year top line comparison. For the full year, we continue to expect an adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 34.5%. This includes approximately $200,000,000 of investment towards new businesses in 2025. While we don’t expect meaningful revenue from our new businesses in the near term, we expect or excuse me. We believe the opportunity is significant and are building with a multiyear view. To wrap up, our q two results reflect strong execution across our strategic priorities, perfecting the core, accelerating growth in in global markets, and expanding beyond the core. We are acting with urgency and focus to drive growth of our core business and to scale services and experiences. And with our strong financial position, we are well equipped to invest in the future in order to create long term value for our investors. With that, I will open it up to Q and A.</p>

[36] <strong>Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb</strong> Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb: Sorry. Sorry. I did not answer the question about events. Can I just do that real quick?</p>

<p><a id="post-37"></a>
[37] <strong>Conference Operator</strong> Conference Operator: Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-38"></a>
[38] <strong>Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb</strong> Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb: So, yeah, yeah. Sorry about that. With regard to the second part of the question about events, you know, first of all, large events have been part of our history. We launched for, you know, during a design conference in 02/2007, then we launched the Democratic National Convention in 02/2008. And what we’ve seen with events is a couple of things. Number one, it’s a great way to build supply in Airbnb. We have more than a 50% increase in amount of homes in Paris on Airbnb because we hosted, for the Olympics. We are a sponsor for the Olympics, and they need housing for events. So we think this is really, really strategic to getting supply in cities. And a lot of people that have no intention to become long term hosts become hosts just once for an event. And what we’ve seen is events are a great hook. To get people that have no intention to becoming long term hosts to try it, and then a bunch of people actually continue hosting because they said, actually, that was a great experience. So events are kind of like a low commitment, high urgency way to get people to try hosting, And what we found is a number of people continue to host. In fact, this is the entire premise of how the company got started. So that’s the first thing. It’s a great way to build supply. The second thing is it’s a great way to build relationships with policymakers, regulators, and increase trust in the brand. For example, Italy is a very strategic market for Airbnb. We certainly had some regulatory challenge in the past to Italy. But Italy, Milan is hosting Cortino are hosting Olympics next year. We were able to make a lot of progress with Italian policymakers because we’re partnering with them on the Olympics. We’re a title sponsor. We’re providing housing in Milan. They don’t have enough housing. They certainly don’t have enough housing in Cortino, so we’re able to support them. FIFA World Cup, gonna be the probably one of the largest, if not the largest event in human history. Think about it. The World Cup is the largest event in the world. This might be the largest World Cup ever. And where are all these people gonna stay? So we’re now working with cities all over The United States, US, you know, Canada, Mexico. And this, I think, has been a gateway to open relations to regulators. The final thing is I think it just increases, our our trust in our brand by associating with the Olympics, the Tour de France, World Cup, Lollapalooza. We’re connecting Airbnb with some of the most beloved brands and some of most passionate fan base and passionate interest. I think Airbnb is such a perfect partner, for these events because many of the events couldn’t happen in the same scale without Airbnb. Tour de France, for example, there aren’t very many hotels along the route, but there are homes. So I think events are just a great part of our strategy, and we’re gonna continue to do a lot more of them. And they’re really part of our roots. So the key question is how do we industrialize this, strategy? And this is something that we’re gonna be continuing to focus on. And maybe the one other thing I’ll just say is now that we have home services and experiences, the partnerships are more efficient because we have more things to cross promote.</p>

[40] <strong>Angela Yang, Director of Investor Relations, Airbnb0</strong> Angela Yang, Director of Investor Relations, Airbnb0: Great. Thank you. First one on the 200,000,000 investment baked into the full year EBITDA guide. Was there a change in expected spend there? I think last quarter you’d said it was 200,000,000 to $250,000,000 for the new 25 business launches and now you’re saying 200,000,000 just for services and experiences. So just wondering should we interpret that to mean there are no other launches this year or is there 50 earmarked for something maybe to be announced? And then second question, just</p>

<p><a id="post-41"></a>
[41] <strong>Ellie Mertz, Chief Financial Officer, Airbnb</strong> Ellie Mertz, Chief Financial Officer, Airbnb: on</p>

<p><a id="post-42"></a>
[42] <strong>Angela Yang, Director of Investor Relations, Airbnb0</strong> Angela Yang, Director of Investor Relations, Airbnb0: the change in definition on nights and seats booked, can you just level set how much of that today is actually like experiences in seats versus stays? Is it 1%? Is that essentially zero? Investors always ask, you know, what’s kind of the breakout of that mix.</p>

<p><a id="post-43"></a>
[43] <strong>Ellie Mertz, Chief Financial Officer, Airbnb</strong> Ellie Mertz, Chief Financial Officer, Airbnb: Yes. Let me let me comment on the $200,000,000 investment. So at the beginning of the year, we gave a range of 200 to $250,000,000 for our new businesses. We have launched those new businesses. It was the reimagined experiences and services. We’re obviously more than halfway through the year, and so we’ve just refined the estimate in terms of the the total investment. There’s there’s no change to strategy or, you know, a a incremental business that is that is truly focused on, experiences and services. We wanted to give you an updated number, now that we have more visibility. In terms of nights and seats booked, we have not historically broken out nights booked versus, experiences booked. We we were not going to do that, today. What I can tell you is that, the seats booked today are indeed immaterial. The intent, obviously, with the launch and our investments here is to scale those businesses such that they are a material contributor to the total.</p>

[45] <strong>Conference Operator</strong> Conference Operator: We will now begin the question and answer session. Our first question will come from the line of Mark Mahaney with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-46"></a>
[46] <strong>Mark Mahaney, Analyst, Evercore ISI</strong> Mark Mahaney, Analyst, Evercore ISI: Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to come back to The U. S. Room night growth and I</p>

<p><a id="post-47"></a>
[47] <strong>Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb</strong> Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb: was also going to end me a</p>

<p><a id="post-48"></a>
[48] <strong>Mark Mahaney, Analyst, Evercore ISI</strong> Mark Mahaney, Analyst, Evercore ISI: little bit. So I guess if we look at The U. S. Growth on room nights excluding services and experiences, Ryan, can you just sort of talk us through the one or two key priorities in your mind to sort of accelerate that growth, into into ’26? And the</p>

<p><a id="post-49"></a>
[49] <strong>Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb</strong> Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb: same question on EMEA. You know, I</p>

<p><a id="post-50"></a>
[50] <strong>Mark Mahaney, Analyst, Evercore ISI</strong> Mark Mahaney, Analyst, Evercore ISI: think you’re growing slower than even your your more scaled competitor in EMEA at this point. How do you think about sort of the keys to driving faster growth in EMEA as you go into 2026?</p>

<p><a id="post-51"></a>
[51] <strong>Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb</strong> Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb: Alright. So, sorry. The question was, the first question was about US, our core market? That’s right.</p>

<p><a id="post-52"></a>
[52] <strong>Angela Yang, Director of Investor Relations, Airbnb1</strong> Angela Yang, Director of Investor Relations, Airbnb1: Yep.</p>

<p><a id="post-53"></a>
[53] <strong>Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb</strong> Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb: Yeah. Yeah. I think that there’s, like, really a few pillars. So one that we’ve seen a lot of traction on is making Airbnb easier to use. We’ve made hundreds of improvements. We highlighted a bunch of them, on the most recent release, and, that has led to hundreds of millions of dollars incremental revenue. So we’ve made a lot of traction, a lot of progress around making it be easier to use. I think pricing and affordability is the next one. We are seeing a huge opportunity around increasing competitiveness of pricing on Airbnb. You might notice that we moved to, total price display. That’s been very successful. We’re now exploring, you know, different ways to present pricing, moving towards a host only fee. We’re doing a lot around giving hosts more tools to make their listings more competitive. We announced, we we announced a new calendar, on the May launch that has better price suggestions. We’re seeing hosts adopt that. When hosts adopt that, they have more competitiveness. And they have more competitive. They earn more money. That’s accretive to our business. So I think pricing is gonna be a huge opportunity for us. And then I think increasing supply. You know? And the way we’re gonna increase supply is we’re not gonna be looking at just the overall top line supply globally. We’re focusing on our most supply constrained markets and really targeting adding supply in those markets. Additionally, you know, people looking for homes, if we don’t get that home, we wanna be able to have a place for them to stay. So we’re also gonna be increasing the onboarding of hotels, especially in supply constrained top markets as well. So I think these are some of the things you’re going to see that are going to absolutely be able to help accelerate growth in The United States.</p>

<p><a id="post-54"></a>
[54] <strong>Conference Operator</strong> Conference Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Patterson with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-55"></a>
[55] <strong>Angela Yang, Director of Investor Relations, Airbnb2</strong> Angela Yang, Director of Investor Relations, Airbnb2: Great. Thank you. Going back to some of the $200,000,000 investment you were talking about, all that sounded like people costs for this year. As we head into 2026, how should we think about that cost potentially scaling up? Do you feel like you have the right number of people in place right now to keep stealing experiences and services, or or is that something that you’re gonna have to kinda keep adding to to bring on more supply? And then just from the the marketing standpoint, you know, we’d love to hear about how you’re thinking about using, performance marketing a bit more, perhaps search to augment, sort of the broader brand campaigns, for the overall business. Thank you.</p>

<p><a id="post-56"></a>
[56] <strong>Mark Mahaney, Analyst, Evercore ISI</strong> Mark Mahaney, Analyst, Evercore ISI: Okay, thanks. I think I’ll just like to ask about Airbnb experiences. And Brian, what have you seen so far? What do you think would be success in terms of, I don’t know, an attach rate? Like what’s the what do you are there proxies or bogeys out there that you’ve seen other companies or in other industries with kind of the attach rate to a core offering that you think, yes, that’s where Airbnb should be? It seems to me like it’s a natural cross sell or add on, but what’s the goal and how long do you think it’ll take to get there? Thank you very much.</p>

<p><a id="post-57"></a>
[57] <strong>Ellie Mertz, Chief Financial Officer, Airbnb</strong> Ellie Mertz, Chief Financial Officer, Airbnb: Yeah. So, Justin, on that 200,000,000, yes, indeed, it is. A good portion of it is headcount, split across both product development as well as, our field operations team as well as some investments in terms of vendors helping us curate and onboard the new supply. When we think about, you know, scaling the investment over time, I’m not gonna I’m not gonna give a, you know, particular figure for next year, but what you should assume is that we will continue to invest in 26 behind these businesses in order to scale them. And some of the, you know, investments this year will carry into next year as, you know, fixed headcount that we brought on to support these businesses. In terms of the second question, Brian, let let me know if you wanna jump in here. You know, we continue to use performance marketing as a, I would say, surgical topper to the majority of our spend being in brand. You know, we’ve talked about this quite a bit over time. Our strategy in terms of the marketing channel mix is obviously quite a bit different from others in that we’re able to benefit from our the strength of our brand and the singularity of our brand to put money in a hard a larger allocation of our marketing spend behind brand versus performance. That being said, we do continue to use performance surgically across the world to, you know, get good returns on those incremental nights. And I would say the the overall intensity, you know, as compared to competitors remains relatively low in that, you know, the metric that we’ve shared over the years, 90% of our traffic coming from direct and, unpaid sources continues to be the the the state of the business, which allows us obviously to spend a lot less on performance marketing than others.</p>

<p><a id="post-58"></a>
[58] <strong>Conference Operator</strong> Conference Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-59"></a>
[59] <strong>Angela Yang, Director of Investor Relations, Airbnb3</strong> Angela Yang, Director of Investor Relations, Airbnb3: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow back up on the experiences side, Brian, and ask about the merchandising, given the Airbnb knows who’s traveling, when you’re traveling, the age of the people traveling, etcetera. You talked a little bit about the test and learn of experiences in cities like Paris. So help us understand if you see just applications continue to balloon for experiences, how you can scale the learnings in Paris to better merchandise overall. And then just as a follow-up, you know, we’ve talking about loyalty programs for some time and how the goal is for Airbnb to launch one that’s differentiated, not just a points program. Any any updated thoughts on this would be helpful. Thank you.</p>

<p><a id="post-60"></a>
[60] <strong>Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb</strong> Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb: Yeah. Absolutely. With experiences, you know, we are doing a lot around testing carousels. If you open the app in, right now, you go to the experiences tab, you’ll see, that we merchandise totally differently. These smaller cards, the different carousels, and the carousels are gonna get more and more personalized. So as we know more about you, we might know where you’re coming from, what kind of price homes you’re searching for, which experience you recently viewed. And the basic idea is to show you a high density amount of experiences that you’re very, very interested in potentially booking. And I think also increasing the touch point. So we’re gonna have the homepage. We’re gonna open right to the homepage if you’re on trip or post booking on home. We’re gonna have other entry points, through the trips tab where we’re merchandising, highlighting. And we’re really just you know, we’re gonna be doing a lot around making sure that we can continue to pull pull hooks in to get people to see the right type of experience on Airbnb. And, you know, we’re we’re obviously if we figure something out in one city, we can immediately roll it out to every city globally that we have the product in. So we think we can do quite a quite a rapid iteration. We have a team in Paris right now, like, kind of a team of product development leaders, designers, engineers into the city to really do really, really tight feedback loop and to figure out the kind of supply that people really want. And we’re really doing a lot with testing ranking to figure out how to make sure that the right people see the right supply and book it. I think that was the first question. The second question was, I think, around loyalty. I think, you know, a loyalty or membership program is a very, very compelling thing for Airbnb. I mean, number one, one of the great things about our business is we have loyal customers. The vast majority our customers come back direct to Airbnb. Hence, why 90% of our traffic is direct or unpaid. It’s because the majority of our bookings come for repeat bookers. We have to pay them to come back. So the best loyalty, of course, is to have a product people love. That being said, I do think we’re sometimes at a competitive disadvantage vis a vis OTAs and hotels because they have a lot of programs we don’t. So I think there’s a lot of upside if we were to have a program. If we were to do something, I don’t think it would be, a traditional points program. I think it would be something much more interesting and novel. But I absolutely think you should see something from us in the future, not imminently, but in the future.</p>

[61] <strong>Conference Operator</strong> Conference Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Ju with UBS. Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-62"></a>
[62] <strong>Angela Yang, Director of Investor Relations, Airbnb1</strong> Angela Yang, Director of Investor Relations, Airbnb1: K. Thank you. So, wanted to follow-up on your commentary on the trips tab because yeah. I mean, from a design perspective, since it is an itinerary, the optimist in me wants to believe that Airbnb will be and should be taking a greater role in the aggregated door to door travel experience. So, you know, are we wrong to think that the expanded travel agent opportunity here? And I I realized that, you know, you just launched experiences, so asking you what’s next, you know, probably sounds a little bit demanding, but sort of the bigger picture of what the itinerary can evolve into will be interesting. And, secondarily, there was a commentary in the letter regarding the new payment methods in Brazil. Do you think the experience that you’ve picked up from doing this initial batch of expansion countries will help you speed up the product development and the cadence of updates for, you know, what must surely be the next batch of new market? Thank you.</p>

<p><a id="post-63"></a>
[63] <strong>Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb</strong> Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb: Yeah. I mean, I I think I can answer both, and maybe I’ll start with the second because it’s kind of tactical. You know, we are massively wrap ramping up development of a product development pace at Airbnb. You know, we do these typically biannual releases, but we are now iterating very, very quick even between these releases. So you’re gonna see and I think the Brazil installment has been a huge example of something that’s been really pop great really, really powerful. Pay zero upfront is starting has been very, very successful. We have an updated cancellation policy that’s rolling out. That’s gonna be success we think it’s gonna be accretive to growth. So we have a real, huge amount of momentum around a lot of optimizations. I think we got a great flywheel. With regards to TripsCab, the itinerary product development, maybe this is an opportunity to talk a little bit more about the long term product vision and where we’re going. And you we couldn’t talk about long term product vision without talking about AI. I haven’t been asked about it, but, I might as well talk about it because I think you can’t do travel planning without AI going forward. We’ve chosen a very specific way to approach AI. A lot of companies have chosen what I would say is the lower stakes part of travel, which is travel planning and inspiration. For AI, we actually start with the hardest problem, which is customer service. Customer service is the hardest problem because the stakes are high. You need answers quickly, and the risk of hallucination is, very, very high. You cannot have a high hallucination rate. And when people are locked out, they wanna cancel reservation, they need help, you need to be accurate. And so what we’ve done is we built a custom model or we’ve we’ve we’ve built a custom agent built on 13 different models that have been tuned off of tens of thousands of conversations. We’ve rolled this out throughout The United States in English, and this is reduced, as I mentioned in the opening remarks, 15% of, people needing to contact human agent when they interact instead with this, AI agent. We’re gonna now, over the course of this year, bring this to more languages. And throughout next year, it’s gonna become more personalized and more agentic. So what this means is that when you reach out to an agent, the AI agent, it will not only tell you how to cancel your reservation, it will know which reservation you wanna cancel. It can cancel it for you, and it could be agentic as in it can start to search and help you plan and book your next trip. Next year, we’re gonna bring AI into travel search. So all this brings us back to the question you asked about travel planning. Over the next couple years, I think what you’re gonna see is Airbnb becoming an AI first application. And this leads to the bigger question around AI. Over the last almost three years since ChatGPT has been out, if you look at the top 50 apps in the App Store, almost none of them are AI apps. The number one app in the App Store, I think, as if as we speak is ChatGPT. And if you go through two through 50, maybe only one or two others are AI native applications. So you’ve got basically AI apps and kinda non AI native apps. And Airbnb would be a non AI native application. Over the next couple years, I believe that every one of those top 50 slots will be AI apps, either start ups or incumbents that transform into being AI native apps. And I think that Airbnb, we are going through that process right now of transitioning from a pre generative AI app to an AI native app. We’re starting a customer service. We’re bringing into travel planning. So It’s really setting the stage.</p>

<p><a id="post-67"></a>
[67] <strong>Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb</strong> Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb: Hey, Mark. Maybe I’ll just, like, zoom out and just talk about experiences and what we’ve seen so far. We’re very, very impressed and satisfied, personally, with the awareness of Airbnb experiences. The biggest problem we’ve had historically, even with the tax rate, people didn’t know you even had Airbnb experiences. The launch turned over 13,000 articles, 660,000,000 social media impressions. We’ve also seen increased visibility of our product through our newly redesigned homepage, and guests really love Airbnb experiences. We talked about, obviously, that they’re significantly rated more highly than homes on Airbnb. There’s a few things. I mean, attach rate, we’re absolutely looking on looking at. We we don’t have any numbers to share as far as what we see for potential attach rate. But we think that attach rate could be significantly higher for the completely reimagined Airbnb experience than the prior iteration of the product. And the way we’re gonna do that is, number one, we need to make sure that we have resident supply, supply that people really, really like. So we’re making sure that we have great listings. This includes Airbnb originals, that are the very best experience on Airbnb. The next thing we wanna do is make sure we have significantly greater entry points for the products. So we’ve really integrated experiences into the core flow. And the third thing is we’re raising awareness about Airbnb experiences, and we think that not only sells experiences but sells more bookings. A couple other things I’ll just share about Airbnb experiences. You know, we’ve had a huge amount of people wanting to list experiences on Airbnb, submit applications. And the other thing, I’ll I’ll just point out Airbnb originals. 40% of bookings for Airbnb originals are from locals for people in the kind of local area, where where the where the booking occurs. So what we’re seeing with Airbnb experiences is even though they’re designed for travelers, we also do expect to start to see more local demand. So I think what we’re gonna see is over the next year, you’re gonna see us really focusing on honing in on the tax rate in key cities. Right now, like, one of the cities we’re really focused on is Paris. It’s a really popular corridor from The United States, and we’re really trying to see what we can do on attach rate in Paris and few other cities like that. Once we get that attach rate up, that will give us a better indication of what’s possible globally. But I’m very, very bullish. I think a large percent of travelers on Airbnb would love to use Airbnb experiences.</p>

[75] <strong>Ellie Mertz, Chief Financial Officer, Airbnb</strong> Ellie Mertz, Chief Financial Officer, Airbnb: Yep. Now we can.</p>

<p><a id="post-76"></a>
[76] <strong>Jed Kelly, Analyst, Oppenheimer</strong> Jed Kelly, Analyst, Oppenheimer: Okay. Great. Yeah. So I wanted to ask you and maybe a follow-up to what you just you were just talking about. So your first thinking on the one to two major product launches, for 2026 key focus areas is the AI travel search you just mentioned, one of those major product launches. And, how are you planning to manage overall company margins, next year taking into account the new launches and also the continued investment in, experiences and services? Thanks.</p>

<p><a id="post-77"></a>
[77] <strong>Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb</strong> Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb: Yeah. Well, you know, generally, we don’t talk about or preview what we’re gonna launch when. So but we are bringing AI more into the app next year so we can confirm that, but we’re not gonna be able to preview what will be and what’s launched. So I’ll let Ellie, though, talk about the second part.</p>

<p><a id="post-79"></a>
[79] <strong>Ellie Mertz, Chief Financial Officer, Airbnb</strong> Ellie Mertz, Chief Financial Officer, Airbnb: Yeah. On margins, I’m I’m not gonna guide right now to 26. What you can assume is that we are, one, continuing to invest in our new businesses and, two, continuing to drive efficiencies across the core business. We’ll give you color in upcoming quarters in terms of, you know, how that nets out with regard to sequential margins.</p>

<p><a id="post-80"></a>
[80] <strong>Jed Kelly, Analyst, Oppenheimer</strong> Jed Kelly, Analyst, Oppenheimer: Okay. Understood. And maybe just a quick follow-up. When you talked about accelerated development pace, is the new tech stack that you rolled in May out in May playing a part in that? And, you know, are you seeing also benefits to customer conversion rates from, what you what this new tech stack has enabled? Thanks.</p>

<p><a id="post-81"></a>
[81] <strong>Ellie Mertz, Chief Financial Officer, Airbnb</strong> Ellie Mertz, Chief Financial Officer, Airbnb: I’d say yes. Absolutely. The new tech stack, we are seeing benefits from that. I would say, more broadly, the investments we’ve made across our infrastructure over the last couple of has really improved the development environment for our team, allowing them to do more and to do more quickly. Obviously, that is increasingly aided by AI as well. And so we hope to see, you know, an increased velocity across our product development road map in coming quarters.</p>

[82] <strong>Conference Operator</strong> Conference Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Gorelski with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.</p>

<p><a id="post-83"></a>
[83] <strong>Colin Sebastian, Analyst, Baird</strong> Colin Sebastian, Analyst, Baird: Yes. Thank you. Two, if I may, please. And you build on some of the other questions. First, Brian, on the AI side, do you anticipate there’s seems like there’s going to need to be a choice made, whether to be open to agents and kind of agent agentic traffic and who will own that relationship versus being more of a closed platform. And given that you have much of your traffic today is direct, and that you have a lot of exclusive supply, you probably have your choice in the matter. So I’d love if you could talk a little bit about that. And then second, maybe, again, bigger picture on strategy. You’re operating against a $90,000,000,000 booking space. And it seems to me that, as you go into things like experiences and services, it’s tough to move the needle. I can understand the ancillary benefits, but it’s tough to move the needle. I guess the question is why you don’t go to really double down on accommodations in the hotel space in at least in your core five markets where, you know, 70 or so of your bookings are? Thank you very much.</p>

<p><a id="post-84"></a>
[84] <strong>Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb</strong> Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb: Yeah. I don’t I don’t think it’s either or. We are doing that, and we’re gonna be going significantly more aggressively into hotels. You know, we’ve we spent a lot of time looking at hotels as a business. We think it’s really compelling, and we think that there’s gonna be a lot more to do with hotels on Airbnb. Our take rate is very, very competitive. We’ve spoken with hotels around the world, especially independents boutiques in bed and breakfast. A huge percent of hotels in Europe are independents. And one of the things they said is they really want incremental travelers. They’d not they have another booking channel. They would love to have high income American young travelers. We’re probably the biggest travel brand in The United States. So I think we’re really, really compelling. And, you know, when we have, you know, I think homes and accommodations or homes will be the heart and soul of Airbnb. But that being said, in our top markets, top top markets, especially during high season, people often don’t find a home. We think hotels would be a great supplement. And so I think there’s a huge amount of growth there. Long term stays, you know, a large percent of our nights booked are for stays longer than thirty days. We think there’s a huge market there as well. Going back to service experiences, you know, I think each of these could easily be a multibillion dollar business. And then the holy grail for services is if it gets happened to local demand. If we didn’t happen to local demand, then it’s not an</p>

<p><a id="post-85"></a>
[85] <strong>Eric Sheridan, Analyst, Goldman Sachs</strong> Eric Sheridan, Analyst, Goldman Sachs: ancillary service. It’s a standalone service.</p>

<p><a id="post-86"></a>
[86] <strong>Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb</strong> Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb: And there is no Amazon for services. Not to say we will become that, but there’s a lot of opportunity there. So it’s an and, not an or. What we’re trying to do is build a platform, a platform that has home, services, experiences, hotels, of course, and much more. And we’re gonna try to be, expanding this platform and continue to launch new businesses, over and over again. I think the other question was sorry. What was the other question?</p>

<p><a id="post-87"></a>
[87] <strong>Colin Sebastian, Analyst, Baird</strong> Colin Sebastian, Analyst, Baird: Sorry. My question was on on AI, the whether</p>

<p><a id="post-88"></a>
[88] <strong>Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb</strong> Brian Chesky, Co-Founder and CEO, Airbnb: Oh, yeah. Sorry. AI is closed. Closed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think we’re still kinda feeling out the state. I think I I the thing I wanna caution is I don’t think that AI agents I don’t think we should think of chatbots like Google. I don’t think we should think of them as the new Google, yet. And the reason why is, like, is an incredibly compelling product. But we also have to remember that the model powering ChatuchuBT is not proprietary. It’s not exclusive to ChatuchuBT. We, Airbnb, can also use the API, and there are other models that we can use. So as I said, in the coming years, you’re gonna have a situation where these large AI models can take more and more, a lot more and more people start there, and people won’t often go to one chatbot to do more and more things. At the same time, you’re gonna also have startups that are gonna be custom built to do a specific application, and you’re gonna have incumbents that make the shift to AI. You know, one of the things we’ve noticed is it’s not enough to just have, it’s not enough to just have, like, the best model. You have to be able to tune the model and build a custom interface for the right application. And I think that’s the key. And the the models are not proprietary. I mean, very few every company that makes a model is selling the model or open sourcing the model in addition to using it themselves. And so I think that the key thing is gonna be for us to lead and become the first place for people to book travel on Airbnb. As far as whether or not we integrate with AI agents, I think that’s something that we’re certainly open to. Remember that to book an Airbnb, you need to have an account. You need to have a verified identity. Almost everyone who books uses our messaging platform. So I don’t think that we’re gonna be the kind of thing where you just have an agent or operator book your Airbnb for you because we’re not a commodity. But I do think it could potentially be a very interesting lead generation for Airbnb. So I think it could be really interesting, but I don’t think it’s like a commodity like booking a flight. I think that’s it. I think we’re over time. So</p>

A: Airbnb reported LTM (TTM) free cash flow of $4.3 billion and corporate cash and investments of $11.4 billion as of June 30, 2025 (reported as “cash and cash equivalents, short‑term investments, and restricted cash”).

[110] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Has Airbnb published a cross‑jurisdiction compliance report or other public disclosure describing how it complies with local licensing, consumer‑safety, and worker‑classification rules for its vetted services and experiences, and if so what jurisdictions or key compliance metrics are listed? A: Short answer: No — as of Aug 7, 2025 Airbnb has not published a single, consolidated cross‑jurisdiction “compliance report” that systematically maps how Services &amp; Experiences comply with local licensing, consumer‑safety, and worker‑classification rules. Instead it publishes host-facing standards (vetting, license/insurance, safety requirements), localized rollouts/City Portal tools and city‑specific registration notices (e.g., France/Berlin/networks of cities), and legal/regulatory disclosures (including worker‑classification risks) in SEC filings and transparency reports.

A: Airbnb repurchased and subsequently retired 8.1 million Class A shares for $1.0 billion in Q2 2025.

A: Short answer: Yes and no. - Yes — Airbnb has publicly stated the buyback is part of a capital‑allocation prioritization (invest in organic growth, strategic acquisitions where relevant, then return capital to shareholders), including in its shareholder letters and SEC filings describing the $6.0B repurchase authorization.

[113] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Has Airbnb published incident SLA targets or an escalation policy that defines mandatory human‑in‑loop thresholds by severity level for its AI customer‑service agent, and if so what SLA targets and severity thresholds were disclosed? A: Short answer: No public, authoritative SLA/escalation matrix with mandatory human‑in‑loop thresholds by severity level has been published by Airbnb as of Aug 7, 2025. Public Airbnb engineering posts describe guardrails, intent-detection and user/IVR options to reach a human (e.g., “press 0”), and press/earnings coverage describes the AI rollout and reduced escalations — but none disclose severity‑tiered SLA targets or mandatory human‑handoff thresholds.

A: Short answer: I could not find any public disclosure by Airbnb of system-level 95th‑percentile latency or production incident‑rate numbers specifically comparing “before” vs “after” the Aug 6, 2025 Summer Release. Airbnb’s Summer Release announcement and Q2‑2025 investor materials don’t publish those engineering metrics, and their engineering blog posts discuss latency measurement practices but do not publish release‑before/after p95 or incident‑rate figures.

[115] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Has Airbnb published the conversion rate from experience applicants to active hosts (applicants → active hosts) in any public filing, shareholder letter, or investor presentation, and if so what is the published conversion rate and the reporting period? A: Short answer: No — I could not find any Airbnb public filing, shareholder letter, or investor presentation that publishes a numerical “applicants → active hosts” conversion rate. Airbnb has disclosed application counts for the relaunched Experiences/Services (e.g., “over 60,000 people have submitted applications” since the May launch in the Q2 2025 earnings transcript) and reports totals like “Hosts” and “active listings” in SEC filings, but it does not publish an applicants→active‑host conversion percentage or a stated reporting period in those materials.

[116] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Has Airbnb published homepage booking conversion rates before and after the August 6, 2025 ‘2025 Summer Release’, and if so what are the reported conversion rates for the pre‑release and post‑release periods? A: Short answer: No — Airbnb has not published numeric “homepage booking conversion rates” for pre‑ vs post‑release. The 2025 Summer Release launched May 13, 2025 (the redesigned homepage/Explore tab), and in the Aug 6, 2025 Q2 results / earnings call Airbnb reported qualitative uplift (a “giant uptick” in bookings from the homepage) but did not provide specific pre‑/post conversion rates. (<a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-2025-summer-release/">news.airbnb.com</a>, <a href="https://www.marketscreener.com/news/airbnb-second-quarter-2025-earnings-transcript-ce7c5edfd08af620?utm_source=chatgpt.com">marketscreener.com</a>) If you’d like, I can search more widely (e.g., investor slide deck PDFs, SEC exhibits, or analyst transcripts) for any numeric A/B test or regional breakdowns that might have been published.</p>

[117] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Has Airbnb published case‑level Net Promoter Score (NPS) or customer satisfaction metrics comparing cases handled by its AI customer‑service agent versus those handled by human agents, and if so what are the published NPS or satisfaction scores by case type? A: Short answer: No — I could not find any public Airbnb publication (press release, earnings deck, engineering blog or paper) that publishes case‑level NPS or satisfaction scores broken down comparing cases handled by Airbnb’s AI agent versus human agents. Airbnb has publicly said its AI agent now serves ~50% of U.S. users and cut escalations to humans by ~15% (earnings call), and its engineering posts describe using a sentiment metric alongside NPS and IVR experiments — but I found no released table/report of NPS or satisfaction by case type (AI vs human).

[118] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Has Airbnb released any municipal‑level or event‑specific analyses that quantify the impact of large sporting/cultural events (e.g., Olympics, World Cup, Tour de France) on local rents or vacancy rates attributable to short‑term listings, and if so what are the reported changes in rent or vacancy? A: Short answer: Yes and mostly no. - Airbnb has published event‑specific metrics (Paris 2024: large spikes in active listings, nights booked, ADR/occupancy and host revenue estimates) but its public newsroom releases report listing/booking/price metrics — not municipal, causal estimates of how a major event changed long‑term rents or vacancy rates attributable to short‑term listings.

[119] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Has Airbnb publicly disclosed operational metrics for its AI customer‑service agent such as escalation rate to human agents, measured error or ‘hallucination’ rates, or coverage of decision‑logging; if so, what escalation and error metrics were published? A: Short answer: Yes, but limited. Airbnb publicly said its new AI agent handles ~50% of U.S. customer interactions and has “reduced the percentage of hosts and guests who needed to contact a human agent by 15%” (Q2 2025 disclosures / CEO remarks). Airbnb’s engineering posts publish related operational metrics (e.g., ASR word‑error‑rate improvement from ~33% → ~10%) and describe guardrails, observability and per‑interaction logging, but they do not publish a numeric “hallucination rate” or a percent coverage figure for decision‑logging in public materials I could find as of Aug 7, 2025. (<a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-q2-2025-financial-results/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">news.airbnb.com</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/automation-platform-v2-improving-conversational-ai-at-airbnb-d86c9386e0cb">medium.com</a>, <a href="https://airbnb.tech/uncategorized/listening-learning-and-helping-at-scale-how-machine-learning-transforms-airbnbs-voice-support-experience/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">airbnb.tech</a>)</p>

[120] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Has Airbnb disclosed the percentage of services bookings made by local residents (‘locals % of services bookings’) or the attach rate of services/experiences per booked trip in its public filings or the Q2 2025 shareholder letter, and if so what are the published percentages or attach rates? A: Short answer: Yes (partial). In the Q2 2025 earnings/ shareholder materials (Aug 6, 2025) Airbnb said ~10% of Services bookings are from “locals” and that 40% of bookings for Airbnb Originals are from locals. They did not publish a company‑wide “attach rate” (i.e., % of trips with an experience/service) in the Q2 2025 shareholder letter or related filings — executives said they are tracking and trying to raise attach rates but gave no global percentage.

[121] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Has Airbnb published details of access controls, token isolation practices, or vendor‑data contracts and audits related to its agentic AI and vendor‑driven experiences, and if so what specific controls or audit findings were disclosed? A: Short answer (as of Aug 7, 2025): Airbnb has published technical descriptions of its access‑management and data‑protection systems (a centralized Access Control Platform, secrets/scan/encryption tooling like Inspekt/Angmar/Cipher), and its Privacy Policy &amp; Services supplements describe subprocessors, DPAs and standard contractual safeguards. However, I found no public, detailed disclosure of token‑isolation designs for “agentic” AI agents nor any public vendor‑audit findings or contractor audit reports about those AI/vendor‑driven experiences. Airbnb’s filings and vendor contracts say vendors must provide SOC/SSAE reports and may be audited, but the company hasn’t published specific audit results.

[122] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Have any third‑party academic papers or municipal studies attributed measurable changes in long‑term rental supply to Airbnb host conversions around major events, and if so what were the quantified effects on long‑term rental stock or vacancy rates reported by those studies? A: Short answer: I could not find a third‑party academic or municipal study that specifically isolates major events (e.g., Olympics, big concerts) as the causal trigger for permanent host conversions and then reports a quantified change in long‑term vacancy rates. Academic work has, however, measured Airbnb’s aggregate effects on long‑term supply: e.g., Horn &amp; Merante (Boston) find a one‑SD rise in Airbnb listings → ~5.9% fewer rental units offered; Barron et al. estimate a 10% rise in Airbnb listings → ~0.39% higher rents and show listings shift supply from long‑ to short‑term. Municipal/industry reports document large event‑period listing spikes (Paris 2024, etc.) but generally do not report causal, persistent vacancy‑rate changes tied to event‑driven conversions. (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1051137717300876?utm_source=chatgpt.com">sciencedirect.com</a>, <a href="https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mksc.2020.1227?utm_source=chatgpt.com">pubsonline.informs.org</a>, <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/e/ukeventsreport?utm_source=chatgpt.com">airbnb.com</a>) If you want, I can run a targeted search for any city‑level post‑event housing reports (e.g., Paris, Rio, host cities) and check for vacancy‑rate estimates.</p>

[123] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: What additional repurchase authorization amount did Airbnb’s board approve in the Q2 2025 shareholder letter, and did the company disclose a timeline or cadence for executing the additional $6.0 billion buyback in that filing or an 8‑K? A: Airbnb’s Q2 2025 shareholder letter/press release said the board approved an additional repurchase authorization of $6.0 billion. The company did not disclose a specific timeline or cadence; the filing/related SEC disclosure states repurchases “may be made from time to time” at management’s discretion and are subject to market/economic/legal conditions (no scheduled cadence provided).

[124] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of August 6, 2025, have any competition authorities opened a formal antitrust investigation or regulator probe into Airbnb’s bundling of homes, services, and experiences, and if so which regulators have opened proceedings and what are the stated allegations or scope? A: Short answer: I found no public record (news releases or competition-authority case dockets) showing that any competition authority had opened a formal antitrust investigation specifically into Airbnb’s recent bundling of Homes + Services + Experiences as of August 6, 2025. Regulators have acted on related issues—e.g., consumer/advertising or listing-compliance probes in Spain and France, ACCC enforcement over pricing/disclosure in Australia, and EU trademark rulings about the scope of Airbnb’s services—but those actions are not framed as formal antitrust “tying/bundling” investigations of the new product bundle.

[141] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: In public disclosures around Q2 2025, did Airbnb report any measured impact of its new AI customer‑service agent on booking conversion rates or on‑trip cross‑sell (Services/Experiences) rates, and if so what uplift or change percentages and measurement periods were disclosed? A: Short answer: No — Airbnb’s Q2 2025 public disclosures only reported the AI customer‑service agent reduced the share of hosts/guests who needed to contact a human agent by ~15% after U.S. rollout; they did not disclose any measured uplift to booking conversion or to on‑trip cross‑sell/attach (Services/Experiences) rates. The company said it’s “looking at” attach rates and described qualitative early momentum, but gave no percentage uplift or formal measurement period for conversion or cross‑sell in the Q2 materials.

[142] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: How did Airbnb phrase the authorization for the additional $6.0 billion share repurchase in its Q2 2025 filings—did the company use language such as ‘may be made from time to time’, specify an expiration date, or state any maximum repurchase amounts per period (daily/weekly)? A: Short answer: Airbnb’s Q2 2025 Form 10‑Q describes the additional $6.0B authorization using open-ended language — repurchases “may be made…from time to time” (via open‑market, negotiated, block or accelerated transactions), are “subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors,” and “do not obligate [the Company] to repurchase any specific number of shares” and “may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time.” The filing does not specify an expiration date for the original Feb 13, 2024 program (it “does not have an expiration date”) and the Q2 filing does not set any daily/weekly maximum repurchase amounts.

A: Short answer: No. Airbnb’s Q2 2025 shareholder letter / press release and the Q2 earnings call described that their new AI customer‑service agent cut the need for human contacts by ~15% and will be rolled out more broadly, but they did not state any specific plan, headcount, budget, or timing targets to redeploy the freed support capacity into specialized escalation teams (safety, cancellations, fraud, etc.).

[145] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Has Airbnb disclosed the share or percentage of nights attributable to hotels within its hotel inventory in the top‑10 metropolitan areas as of Q2 2025, and if so what percentage and reporting period were reported? A: Short answer: No — Airbnb’s public Q2‑2025 materials do not report a percent of nights “attributable to hotels within its hotel inventory” for the top‑10 metropolitan areas. Airbnb’s Q2 2025 press release/shareholder letter and the company’s SEC filings discuss hotels and market‑share qualitatively (and hotel strategy), but do not provide the specific top‑10‑metro hotel‑nights percentage or a dedicated reporting period for that metric.

[146] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: In the Q2 2025 shareholder letter or associated public filings, did Airbnb disclose a minimum cash balance or ‘cash floor’ policy tied to the newly authorized $6.0 billion share repurchase, and if so what minimum cash balance or policy language was stated and as of what date? A: Short answer: No. Airbnb’s Q2‑2025 shareholder materials and related SEC filing did not state a specific “cash floor” or minimum cash balance tied to the newly authorized $6.0B repurchase. Instead the filings state repurchases “will be made from time to time subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other relevant factors” and that the program “does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time at our discretion.” (Disclosure refers to cash levels as of June 30, 2025 and notes the board approved the additional $6.0B authorization in August 2025).

[147] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Has Airbnb publicly released any legally enforceable community‑benefit agreements (CBAs), conditional event‑housing contracts, or comparable documents tied to its major‑event partnerships (Olympics, FIFA, Tour de France) as of August 6, 2025, and if so which jurisdictions and what mitigation measures (e.g., host registration, temporary short‑term caps, affordable‑housing levies) do those documents specify? A: Short answer: No authoritative, publicly posted, legally enforceable “community‑benefit agreements” or event‑housing contracts that Airbnb itself tied directly to its IOC/FIFA/Tour‑de‑France sponsorships were found as of Aug 6, 2025. Airbnb’s public materials are sponsorship/partnership announcements (IOC, FIFA, Tour de France), while legally enforceable mitigation measures instead exist via local laws or city‑level settlements/agreements (examples below). I did not find a standalone, event‑specific CBA published by Airbnb. Examples of public, enforceable local measures Airbnb has accepted/implemented: - Santa Monica settlement (Airbnb must require city license numbers on listings, limit listings per host, collect $2/night for affordable housing). (<a href="https://www.santamonica.gov/press/2019/12/10/settlement-with-airbnb-guarantees-compliance-with-home-sharing-ordinance?utm_source=chatgpt.com">santamonica.gov</a>) - Los Angeles local rules enforced via platform (host registration, 120‑day default cap; Airbnb collects/remits city TOTs).

[148] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of August 6, 2025, has Airbnb publicly disclosed any memoranda of understanding (MOUs), pilot agreements, or technical integrations (for example, registration APIs) with host‑city governments arising from its event partnerships (Olympics, FIFA World Cup, Tour de France), and if so which cities and what principal terms were described? A: Short answer (as of Aug 6, 2025): Yes — but mostly via platform‑level/pilot integrations rather than widely published city MOUs tied to specific events. What’s publicly disclosed - Airbnb has rolled out its City Portal and data‑sharing pilots with many local governments (pilot cities named by Airbnb include Buffalo, Seattle, San Francisco, Sacramento, Vancouver, etc.). (<a href="https://news.airbnb.com/cityportal/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">news.airbnb.com</a>) - Los Angeles approved a compliance/platform agreement with Airbnb to verify listing registration status under LA’s short‑term rental rules (relevant to LA/2028). (<a href="https://lasentinel.net/l-a-city-council-approves-compliance-platform-agreement-with-airbnb.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com">lasentinel.net</a>) - For event partnerships: Airbnb’s FIFA and IOC press releases commit to “working with” Host Cities (FIFA Host City Impact Program / $5M) and to supporting Paris/France registration rules, but those releases do not publish signed city‑level MOUs or full API contract terms for each host city. (Examples: FIFA and IOC announcements; Airbnb France registration pages.)

[149] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Has Airbnb published Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) or DevOps performance KPIs—such as deployment frequency, mean time to detect, mean time to remediate (MTTR), rollback rate, or similar metrics—attributable to its rebuilt tech stack or the ‘2025 Summer Release’ in public engineering blogs or investor disclosures, and if so what KPI values and reporting periods were provided? A: Short answer: No — Airbnb’s public engineering posts and investor disclosures describe the rebuilt stack and say reliability/deployment cadence improved, but they do not publish organization‑level SRE/DORA KPI values (deployment frequency, MTTD/MTTR, rollback or change‑failure rates) tied to the rebuilt stack or the “2025 Summer Release.” Engineering blogs note per‑service dashboards and qualitative increases in deploy frequency and fewer regressions, and conference summaries report historical deploy counts (e.g., hundreds/day or ~125k/year), but Airbnb’s investor releases likewise mention the rebuilt stack and product launch without publishing formal SRE KPI numbers or reporting periods.

[150] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Did Airbnb disclose the total number of Services (Experiences/Services) applicants (reported informally as ~60,000) in Q2 2025 public filings or investor presentations, and did the company provide any geographic or segment breakdown for those applicants? A: Short answer: Yes — Airbnb publicly stated “since launch, over 60,000 people have submitted applications to host a service or experience” in its Q2‑2025 investor communications (earnings call / press release and shareholder update). The company did not provide a geographic or segment breakdown of those applicants in the public filing (Form 10‑Q) or in the earnings/IR materials I reviewed.

[151] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: In Q2 2025 disclosures or investor materials, what percentage of Airbnb’s homepage and Trips tab traffic did the company report as direct/unpaid traffic, and what reporting period and measurement methodology were disclosed for that figure? A: Airbnb stated in its Q2 2025 investor materials/earnings call that roughly “90% of our traffic comes from direct and unpaid sources.” The Q2 2025 materials/transcript do not specify a reporting period or a detailed measurement methodology for that 90% figure. The most explicit prior disclosure is in Airbnb’s S‑1/SEC filings (≈91% direct/unpaid for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2020), where “direct or unpaid” was described as the remainder of traffic after paid performance channels (i.e., brand, SEO, direct channels).

[152] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: In the Q2 2025 shareholder letter or earnings release, how did Airbnb describe its capital‑allocation priority between growth/M&amp;A and shareholder returns (repurchases/dividends), and what was the exact wording or order presented in those materials? A: Airbnb said its capital‑allocation priority was (1) investments in organic growth, (2) strategic acquisitions or partnerships, and (3) return of capital to shareholders. Exact wording (from the Q2 shareholder materials): “The repurchase program continues to be executed as part of our broader capital allocation strategy which prioritizes investments in organic growth, strategic acquisitions or partnerships, and return of capital to shareholders, in that order.” (<a href="https://jaunt.com/j/airbnb-q2-2025-shareholder-update-3309?utm_source=chatgpt.com">jaunt.com</a>, <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-q2-2025-financial-results/">news.airbnb.com</a>)</p>

A: Airbnb’s Q2 2025 materials set a full‑year Adjusted EBITDA margin target of at least 34.5%. Yes — the company explicitly said that guidance is inclusive of roughly $200 million of investment in new businesses (some filings described the planned spend as $200–$250 million).

[174] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: In Q2 2025 public filings or investor materials, did Airbnb commit to providing standardized APIs for third‑party agents or integrators (for example registration or booking APIs for city governments or vendor agents), and if so what API specifications or rollout timelines were disclosed? A: Short answer: No. Airbnb’s Q2 2025 public filings and investor materials do not announce a new, company‑wide commitment to ship standardized registration/booking APIs for cities or third‑party agents, nor do they publish API specifications or a rollout timeline in those materials. (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001559720/000155972025000025/abnb-20250630.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com">sec.gov</a>) Context: Airbnb already offers government tools (City Portal) and runs partner/API programs (with program requirements such as NDAs, security review and a six‑month implementation rule for released features), but those are existing programs rather than a new Q2 2025 commitment with public specs or timelines.

It referred to the metric as measured “since launch” (the Summer Release launched May 13, 2025) but the Q2 press materials and earnings transcript do not provide a precise measurement window or a sample size (number of bookings/reviews) for that 4.93 figure.

A: Airbnb said its May 2025 “2025 Summer Release” generated “more than 13,000 press stories” (≈13,000 articles) and “nearly 660 million social media impressions” in its Q2 2025 earnings materials (shareholder/earnings release published Aug 6, 2025).

[181] <strong>Legal Scholar, Digital Markets</strong> [Strength] Airbnb’s City Portal, prior city settlements (e.g., LA, Santa Monica) and major event sponsorships provide credible operational leverage and an existing technical channel to negotiate enforceable event‑specific MOUs/CBAs and staged data‑sharing pilots—mechanism: sponsorship bargaining power + platform tooling lowers regulatory friction for host onboarding [Status: VERIFIED] | Falsifier: no City Portal or city agreements public {Conf: Med} <em>(🔄 13)</em></p>

[193] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of August 6, 2025, has Airbnb disclosed in any public filing or investor presentation a repurchase framework that conditions share buybacks on verifiable compliance milestones (for example city MOUs/API rollouts, percentage of vendor audits meeting SOC‑2, or AI agent SLA/escalation metrics); and if so what specific milestones, thresholds, and citation(s) were provided? A: Short answer: No. As of August 6, 2025 Airbnb’s public filings and investor materials announce board‑authorized repurchase authorizations (a new $6.0B program on Aug 6, 2025) but describe repurchases as made “at management’s discretion” and “subject to market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors.” They do not condition buybacks on verifiable compliance milestones (city MOUs/API rollouts, SOC‑2 vendor audit thresholds, AI‑agent SLA/escalation metrics) or list specific milestone thresholds. (<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001559720/000155972025000025/abnb-20250630.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com">sec.gov</a>, <a href="https://investors.airbnb.com/press-releases/news-details/2025/Airbnb-Announces-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com">investors.airbnb.com</a>) If you’d like, I can search older filings, investor decks, or earnings‑call transcript excerpts for any narrowly worded language you’re worried might be interpreted as milestone‑linked.</p>

[194] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Beyond open‑ended language that repurchases ‘may be made from time to time,’ did Airbnb publicly disclose any prescriptive buyback execution framework in Q2 2025 filings or subsequent 8‑K/proxy (for example an annual tranche cap, valuation trigger, minimum cash floor, or leverage trigger); and if so what specific numeric thresholds and filing citations were provided? A: No. In the Q2 2025 Form 10‑Q (quarter ended June 30, 2025) and in the 2025 definitive proxy, Airbnb disclosed only discretionary, open‑ended repurchase language (repurchases “may be made from time to time…,” authorization dollar amounts and amounts executed/remaining). The filings do not set prescriptive execution triggers, annual tranche caps, minimum‑cash floors, valuation/price triggers, or leverage limits with numeric thresholds. (See the “Share Repurchase Program” / Item 2 (Use of Proceeds) and Note 13 (Subsequent Event) in the 10‑Q; and the DEF 14A proxy discussion of repurchases).

[195] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of August 6, 2025, has Airbnb publicly disclosed service‑level objectives (SLOs) and end‑to‑end surge‑test results for its rebuilt platform that report p95 latency and error‑rate for vendor APIs, onboarding queue depth, and AI→human handoff; and if so what metric values and reporting dates were published and where? A: Short answer: No — I could not find a public, single disclosure from Airbnb (as of Aug 6, 2025) that publishes end‑to‑end surge‑test SLOs covering p95 latency and error‑rate for vendor APIs, onboarding‑queue depth, and AI→human handoff together with numeric values and formal reporting dates. What is public: - Airbnb’s engineering posts describe their load‑testing framework (Impulse; Jun 9, 2025) but don’t publish a consolidated set of SLO numbers or end‑to‑end surge test result tables. (<a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/load-testing-with-impulse-at-airbnb-f466874d03d2?utm_source=chatgpt.com">medium.com</a>) - An Airbnb AI support post (Aug 10, 2021) gives a p95 model‑inference example (~60 ms for a ~1.1B‑param model) — that’s a model latency datapoint, not a full platform SLO suite. (<a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/task-oriented-conversational-ai-in-airbnb-customer-support-5ebf49169eaa">medium.com</a>) - Business/earnings disclosures note AI rollout and impact (50% U.S. users on the AI agent; ~15% fewer live escalations) but do not publish the requested p95/error‑rate/queue‑depth SLO matrices. (<a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-q1-2025-financial-results/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">news.airbnb.com</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/02/airbnb-is-quietly-rolling-out-an-ai-customer-service-bot-in-the-us/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">techcrunch.com</a>) If you want, I can run a deeper search (press releases, GitHub, conference talks, regulatory filings) for any narrow/hidden report or contact links.</p>

<p><a id="post-196"></a>
[196] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Has Airbnb published municipal‑ or ZIP‑level metrics such as ‘host income by ZIP’ or ‘services vendor payroll’ that quantify local economic impact or uplift from Events and Services; and if so which jurisdictions and what metric values and reporting periods were disclosed? A: Short answer: Yes—Airbnb publicly posts city/metro/county/state-level economic‑impact reports (host earnings, guest spending, jobs, tax revenue) for specific places and years (e.g., U.S. 2024 and 2023 reports; Austin, Atlanta, Colorado counties). (<a href="https://news.airbnb.com/economic-impact-2024-us/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">news.airbnb.com</a>) No—there is no publicly posted, company‑published dataset that systematically reports “host income by ZIP” or a “services/vendor payroll” series tied to Airbnb Events/Services as of Aug 7, 2025. Airbnb has historically shared occasional neighborhood figures with press (examples exist from earlier years) but granular ZIP‑level or vendor‑payroll tables are not published publicly; instead Airbnb provides more detailed, private data access to governments via its City Portal. (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-host-median-income-2016-7?utm_source=chatgpt.com">businessinsider.com</a>, <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/cityportal/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">news.airbnb.com</a>) If you want, I can (a) run a deeper search for any city‑specific ZIP breakout or (b. request sample City Portal fields reported to jurisdictions.</p>

[197] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: As of August 6, 2025, has Airbnb published measured per‑trip revenue uplift or RevPAR increases attributable to Services/Experiences cross‑sell (for example incremental revenue per trip or RevPAR lift) in any shareholder letter, earnings release, or investor presentation; and if so what uplift percentages, baseline definitions, sample sizes, and reporting periods were disclosed? A: Short answer: No. I found no shareholder letter, earnings release, or investor presentation from Airbnb through Aug 6, 2025 that publishes a measured per‑trip incremental‑revenue percentage or RevPAR lift explicitly attributable to Services/Experiences cross‑sell — Airbnb’s Q2‑2025 materials describe “early momentum,” ratings and host application counts but do not report uplift percentages, baseline definitions, sample sizes, or reporting periods. (<a href="https://investors.airbnb.com/press-releases/news-details/2025/Airbnb-Announces-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com">investors.airbnb.com</a>, <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-q2-2025-financial-results/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">news.airbnb.com</a>) Notes/sources: Airbnb’s Q2‑2025 financial results and press release (May launch of Services/relaunched Experiences; mentions ratings and &gt;60k host applications) and linked investor materials show qualitative/aggregate metrics (Nights/Seats Booked, GBV, ADR) but no quantified per‑trip or RevPAR cross‑sell lift. (<a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-q2-2025-financial-results/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">news.airbnb.com</a>, <a href="https://investors.airbnb.com/press-releases/news-details/2025/Airbnb-Announces-Second-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx?utm_source=chatgpt.com">investors.airbnb.com</a>)</p>

[198] <strong>Research Agent</strong> 🔍 Q: Has Airbnb publicly reported same‑day fulfillment, same‑day cancellation, or same‑day refund rates for vetted Services/Experiences since launching in‑trip browsing or the 2025 Summer Release; and if so what were the reported same‑day fulfillment and same‑day cancellation/refund percentages and the reporting period? A: Short answer: No — Airbnb’s public materials since the May 13, 2025 Summer Release (in‑trip browsing / Services &amp; reimagined Experiences) do not publish specific “same‑day” fulfillment or same‑day cancellation/refund percentages or a reporting period. Airbnb’s Summer Release, the Services/Experiences refund/cancellation help pages, and the company’s Q2‑2025 investor/press materials describe the launch, policies and early momentum but do not report same‑day metric percentages. I found no public SEC/investor filing or company blog post that gives those rates as of Aug 6, 2025.
