          <p>This briefing reviews Eli Lilly’s Q2 2025 results and management commentary — revenue $15.56 billion (+38% y/y), non‑GAAP EPS $6.31, raised FY revenue guidance to $60.0–62.0 billion, accelerated incretin production (>1.6× sellable doses YTD, target ≥1.8×) and completed SiteOne and Verve acquisitions, alongside clinical headlines (ATTAIN‑one orforglipron: highest dose 12.4% mean weight loss, >27 lb; SURPASS‑CVOT tirzepatide: non‑inferior vs dulaglutide, ~8% lower MACE‑3, 16% lower all‑cause mortality). The report maps the reasoning space behind management’s outlook, probes hidden assumptions about manufacturing scale, demand sustainability, pricing and regulatory risk, and highlights blind spots investors should monitor.</p>

          <p>This report examines the strategic and financial implications from Disney’s Q3 FY25 earnings call, focusing on the announced global integration of Hulu into Disney+, the August 21 launch of an ESPN direct‑to‑consumer service, a non‑binding agreement for ESPN to acquire NFL Network and related assets in exchange for a 10% equity stake, and operational highlights such as Lilo & Stitch’s box‑office strength and Disney Cruise Line expansion. It maps the reasoning space for investors by probing key assumptions, execution and approval risks (including that transactions remain subject to definitive agreements and closing conditions), and identifying disclosure blind spots for further diligence.</p>

          <p>This report examines Airbnb’s Q2 2025 results and guidance—covering revenue, margins, cash flow, buybacks, balance-sheet items, and the new “2025 Summer Release” (app, Services, Experiences) and AI customer‑service initiative—to assess drivers of near‑term performance and medium‑term growth. It maps the reasoning space for investors by probing management’s demand, supply, and monetization assumptions, and flags blind spots such as host-supply dynamics, sustainability of margins and buybacks, funds‑held accounting, competitive/regulatory risks, and execution risk on new products.</p>

          <p>This report examines AMD's strong Q2 2025 results—$7.7 billion revenue (+32% YoY) and over $1 billion in free cash flow—driven by record EPYC and Ryzen sales, AI-led Data Center growth, the MI350 ramp, and an $800 million export-related Instinct MI308 inventory write-down. It maps the reasoning space for investment decisions by probing key assumptions and potential blind spots—sustainability of AI-driven demand, export-control and China exposure, timing and scale of MI350/MI400 ramps, margin durability after one-time charges, and operational or regulatory risks from supply-chain and sovereign AI partnerships.</p>

It focuses on drivers including robust ad revenue and AI-enhanced engagement, the company’s rapid scaling of multi‑gigawatt AI infrastructure and sharply higher capex, persistent Reality Labs losses, evolving EU regulatory/privacy risks, and the implications of Meta’s capital allocation strategy (dividends, buybacks, and asset sales).</p>
