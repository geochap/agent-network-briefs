## Executive Summary

Lilly delivered a high‑quality Q2 print with 38% y/y revenue growth, non‑GAAP EPS of $6.31, and a guidance raise to $60.0–$62.0 billion, underpinned by volume rather than price and a continued ramp in incretin output (>1.6× sellable doses year‑to‑date; ≥1.8× for 2025). Margins expanded (performance margin 45.9%), cash returns continued (dividend and buybacks), and management highlighted incremental on‑shore capacity coming online. Offsetting these strengths, the franchise remains concentrated in incretins (>55% of Q2 sales) and faces near‑term U.S. formulary frictions (CVS exclusion), even as LillyDirect scaled to ≈1.1M Q2 TRx and cash‑pay vials supported demand resilience. The net reads as a volume‑led growth story with visible execution levers—and visible channel risks that could modulate the growth rate quarter‑to‑quarter. [[34]](#post-34) [[160]](#post-160) [[151]](#post-151) [[110]](#post-110) [[114]](#post-114) [[52]](#post-52)

Clinically, management’s topline disclosures create both upside and diligence requirements. ATTAIN‑one showed class‑consistent weight loss for oral, once‑daily orforglipron (up to 12.4% mean loss at the highest dose), with GI AEs typical of GLP‑1 and no hepatic signal reported; SURPASS‑CVOT met non‑inferiority on MACE‑3 vs dulaglutide and signaled reductions in all‑cause mortality, with an additional pre‑specified indirect comparison to a putative placebo. Investors should press for full SAP/estimand and missing‑data methods for ATTAIN‑one (given differential discontinuation that can bias efficacy), hepatic‑safety adjudication details, and patient‑level matching diagnostics and sensitivity analyses for SURPASS‑CVOT’s indirect comparison before underwriting durable cardioprotection premia. EASD presentations and peer‑reviewed publications are near‑term catalysts to resolve these uncertainties and to enable outcomes‑based contracting if the evidence stands. [[23]](#post-23) [[45]](#post-45) [[205]](#post-205) [[104]](#post-104) [[231]](#post-231) [[223]](#post-223) [[112]](#post-112) [[180]](#post-180) [[244]](#post-244) [[137]](#post-137) [[204]](#post-204)

Access dynamics will shape orforglipron’s commercial slope. PBMs can blunt uptake via step edits, prior auth, BMI/comorbidity thresholds and narrow template formularies; no orforglipron‑specific U.S. policies are public pre‑approval, but class rules are well established. LillyDirect is a strategic asset—both as a bridge in coverage gaps and as a data engine for payer‑grade RWE—but it carries equity and policy exposure if demographic/payer‑mix transparency and low‑digital‑access adaptations lag. Employer coverage remains steady but not universal, and no public payer has announced MACE‑linked outcomes contracts for tirzepatide. Net, evidence‑gated coverage pilots and pre‑registered RWE plans could accelerate access while containing payer risk; absent these, PBM and employer caution may force greater net‑price concessions. [[92]](#post-92) [[129]](#post-129) [[297]](#post-297) [[52]](#post-52) [[177]](#post-177) [[157]](#post-157) [[109]](#post-109) [[156]](#post-156) [[29]](#post-29) [[166]](#post-166)

Execution risk concentrates in manufacturing and disclosures. The ≥1.8× incretin‑dose ramp is a core bull pillar, yet single‑source APIs/excipients, sterile fill‑finish capacity, tech‑transfer/commissioning timelines, and inland logistics can create bottlenecks; Lilly cites internal builds and multiple CMOs as mitigants, but a granular multi‑source map is not public. Environmental footprint disclosures at the dose level are absent as capacity expands—an emerging ESG blind spot that can translate into permitting and reputational risk—though state permit filings provide interim, trackable KPIs and on‑shore builds could enable greener process design. Publishing operational supply KPIs and “proof‑of‑capacity” stress tests would further de‑risk the ramp. [[108]](#post-108) [[96]](#post-96) [[186]](#post-186) [[153]](#post-153) [[200]](#post-200) [[141]](#post-141) [[121]](#post-121) [[107]](#post-107) [[197]](#post-197) [[226]](#post-226) [[270]](#post-270) [[271]](#post-271) [[198]](#post-198)

Regulatory/legal overhangs are manageable but non‑trivial. Vertical moves (LillyDirect), high incretin share, and recent M&A raise antitrust scrutiny risk conceptually, yet Verve cleared HSR early and SiteOne appears non‑horizontal, with no agency actions disclosed as of the quarter. Securities‑disclosure risk is currently low (no suits identified), but selective or incomplete trial disclosures (SAP/estimand, AE timing, subgroup heterogeneity) could invite challenges—arguing for proactive transparency at EASD and beyond. Internationally, oral GLP‑1s promise APAC access advantages, but no country‑level launch or reimbursement metrics exist yet. Near‑term, the investment case hinges on converting clinical signals into payer‑validated access at scale while sustaining the dose ramp and closing known data gaps.

## Orforglipron Market Access and Payer Dynamics: Coverage, Cash Channels, and Value-Based Contracts

Coverage gating, channel mix, and contract design will dictate orforglipron’s early adoption curve and net price realization. PBMs already manage GLP‑1s with prior authorization, BMI/comorbidity thresholds, and step‑therapy; while no orforglipron‑specific rules exist pre‑approval, these class tools are in place and could blunt uptake and push net prices lower [[92]](#post-92) [[129]](#post-129) [[297]](#post-297). The CVS exclusion illustrates near‑term formulary risk to growth even amid robust demand [[114]](#post-114). 

LillyDirect is shaping the channel strategy: at ≈1.1M Q2 TRx, with cash‑pay vials ~20% of U.S. Zepbound TRx and >35% of new starts, it acts as a bridge while employer opt‑ins hover ~50–55% and class coverage evolves [[177]](#post-177) [[52]](#post-52) [[29]](#post-29). This scale also creates a potential RWE engine to accelerate access and support value‑based models (evidence‑gated oral‑first, outcomes rebates), though public payer MACE‑linked deals have not yet materialized [[157]](#post-157) [[211]](#post-211) [[137]](#post-137) [[166]](#post-166).

> “Balanced: Lilly's manufacturing ramp… is a material strength… Conversely, revenue concentration in incretins plus payer actions (CVS exclusion), cash‑channel competition (compounding/Canadian generics) and potential international pricing reform create downside via fewer new starts and compressed net pricing.” [[114]](#post-114)  
— Sell‑side Pharma Equity Analyst; Support: 5

### Analysis

The dominant view is that payer controls and template formularies will shape orforglipron’s initial slope, making LillyDirect‑enabled RWE and outcomes constructs the most credible route to faster access and defensible net price. Dissent centers on two blind spots: reliance on a cash/DTC channel that may exacerbate access gaps and reputational/policy risk, and exposure to formulary shocks (e.g., CVS) that can slow new starts and pressure net price despite strong demand [[92]](#post-92) [[157]](#post-157) [[109]](#post-109) [[114]](#post-114). Key uncertainties include the absence of orforglipron‑specific PBM policies pre‑approval, the speed at which evidence‑gated pilots are adopted, and whether cardioprotection signals translate into public value‑based contracts and preferential placement at scale [[129]](#post-129) [[211]](#post-211) [[137]](#post-137) [[166]](#post-166).

## Evidence Quality and Clinical Interpretability: ATTAIN-one Estimands, SURPASS-CVOT Indirectness, and Subgroup Transparency

The investment case for orforglipron and incremental cardiovascular value for tirzepatide hinges on methodological clarity and interpretability. For ATTAIN‑one, Lilly disclosed the primary “efficacy” estimand but has not posted the full SAP or missing‑data methods; discontinuation differentials versus placebo raise concern that informative missingness could bias efficacy if analyses rely on on‑treatment/completer populations. For SURPASS‑CVOT, the non‑inferiority result is clear, but the cardioprotection claim rests on a pre‑specified indirect match to a putative placebo, which requires patient‑level diagnostics and robustness checks to be credible for payer use. Investors and payers will look for SAP‑level transparency (estimands, missing‑data rules, sensitivity/tipping‑point outputs), subgroup tables, and event‑adjudication governance to underwrite durable pricing and outcomes‑based contracts.

A related blind‑spot is hepatic safety in ATTAIN‑one: topline claims of “no hepatic signal” lack public protocol detail (LFT cadence, Hy’s‑Law criteria, blinded adjudication charter, post‑treatment follow‑up). Absent DSMB and CEC/AE adjudication disclosures, securities‑disclosure risk and payer skepticism rise. EASD presentations and peer‑reviewed manuscripts are the near‑term venue to resolve these uncertainties and translate signals into coverage and value.

### Supporting Voices

> “SURPASS CVOT’s claim of cardioprotection rests on a pre-specified indirect matched comparison to putative placebo [Status: UNVERIFIED]; because there was no placebo arm, residual confounding, differing event definitions, and secular care differences can inflate apparent benefit—investors should demand patient‑level matching diagnostics, propensity overlap plots, and sensitivity analyses (E‑values, alternative matchers) before valuing an incremental survival benefit.” [[112]](#post-112)  
— Clinical Trials Auditor; Support: 19

> “Key statistical methods (primary estimand and missing‑data handling) for ATTAIN‑one are not disclosed [Status: UNKNOWN]; because placebo discontinuation (29.9%) vs active (22–24%) is substantial, on‑treatment/completer analyses could upward‑bias efficacy if missingness is informative. | Falsifier: publish SAP/estimand details” [[104]](#post-104)  
— Clinical Trials Auditor; Support: 18

> “Recommend Lilly publish ATTAIN‑1’s primary estimand, detailed SAP missing‑data rules, and pre‑specified sensitivity outputs (MMRM vs multiple imputation vs delta‑adjusted pattern‑mixture, tipping‑point analyses, subgroup attrition tables) so payers can quantitatively assess informative‑dropout risk and reduce reimbursement uncertainty [Status: UNKNOWN: public SAP/sensitivity outputs].” [[231]](#post-231)  
— Clinical Trials Auditor; Support: 18

> “Ask Lilly to publish a short, standardized dashboard: 6‑ and 12‑month real‑world adherence, primary‑care vs specialist initiation %, LillyDirect payer/demographic breakdown, and country‑level launch timelines—because transparent metrics will reduce investor uncertainty and counter misinformation [Status: UNKNOWN]” [[146]](#post-146)  
— Science Communications Educator; Support: 19

### Minority / Dissent

> “ACHIEVE‑1’s NEJM publication included prespecified estimand and analysis‑method details in its supplement [Status: INCONCLUSIVE]; because Lilly has precedent for SAP‑level transparency, investors can reasonably expect ATTAIN‑1 to report estimands, missing‑data methods and subgroup tables at EASD/publication, which would materially reduce bias concerns from differential discontinuation.” [[194]](#post-194)  
— Science Communications Educator; Support: 4

> “Lilly’s explicit commitments—to present SURPASS‑CVOT and ATTAIN/ACHIEVE results at EASD, publish peer‑reviewed manuscripts, and run additional Phase III/post‑approval trials (maintenance, hypertension, OA knee, etc.)—create an evidentiary pathway for granular subgroup, longitudinal safety, and real‑world analyses that can inform equitable access and payer decisions [Status: INCONCLUSIVE].” [[140]](#post-140)  
— Science Communications Educator; Support: 4

### Analysis
Most contributors converge on a transparency-first stance: ATTAIN‑one needs full SAP/estimand and missing‑data disclosures (plus sensitivity and subgroup outputs), and SURPASS‑CVOT’s indirect cardioprotection claim requires patient‑level matching diagnostics and robustness analyses before investors and payers should capitalize incremental survival benefits. The minority view argues recent precedent (ACHIEVE‑1 supplement) and EASD/publication commitments will address gaps. The tension matters because valuation of orforglipron’s real‑world effect size and tirzepatide’s cardioprotective premium depends on these methods; unresolved issues around informative dropout, hepatic adjudication, and unverified indirect comparisons remain key uncertainties until full materials are public.

## Manufacturing Scale-Up and Supply Chain Resilience: Delivering the 1.8x Dose Ramp

Lilly’s 2025 guidance and volume-led earnings momentum hinge on sustaining the incretin dose ramp from >1.6× in 1H to ≥1.8× for the full year, with management pointing to new internal capacity (notably RTP) and two additional U.S. plants to be named, while framing margin benefits from mix and fixed-cost absorption if volumes deliver [[23]](#post-23) [[34]](#post-34) [[110]](#post-110). The strategic logic is clear: more sellable doses directly expand TRx, buffer formulary shocks, and support channel/pricing flexibility—but execution risks remain where public granularity is thin.

Primary concerns flagged by multiple specialists include single-/concentrated-source APIs and excipients, sterile fill–finish slot scarcity, long tech-transfer/qualification timelines, and inland logistics/weather disruptions that could push validation and release schedules right as Lilly targets the incremental step-up in 2H [[96]](#post-96) [[108]](#post-108) [[186]](#post-186) [[259]](#post-259). Mitigants cited are parallel internal build-outs plus multiple CDMOs, onshoring as a hedge, and shifting mix toward oral solid dose as pills launch; however, investors still lack a published multi-source supplier map, per-site throughput, or non-sterile vs sterile capacity split, making independent tracking via permits and proposed stress tests especially valuable [[153]](#post-153) [[200]](#post-200) [[141]](#post-141) [[116]](#post-116) [[170]](#post-170) [[247]](#post-247) [[215]](#post-215) [[271]](#post-271) [[198]](#post-198).

### Supporting Voices

> “Recommend Lilly run and publish a concrete ‘proof‑of‑capacity’ stress test: two geographically‑separated qualified sites (internal or CMO) each sustain ≥25% of the incremental sellable‑dose target for 8 consecutive weeks, reporting weekly qualified‑batch counts and median lot‑release times to visibly de‑risk the 1.8× ramp for investors.” [[271]](#post-271)

— Environmental Impact Assessor; Support: 17

### Minority / Dissent

> “Lilly’s rapid onshore scale‑up (Research Triangle Park + two planned U.S. plants; 1.6→1.8× sellable‑dose target) is a material supply‑chain hedge because domestic capacity shortens lead times, enables buffer inventories and reduces exposure to overseas export controls/logistics shocks.” [[141]](#post-141)  
— Global Supply Chain Specialist; Support: 4

### Analysis
The split is between risk-centric views (supplier concentration, fill–finish/API bottlenecks, tech-transfer/inspection lag, inland logistics) and a more confident outlook that onshoring and multi‑site/CMO diversification will cushion shocks. The disagreement persists because key de‑risking evidence remains unpublished: no multi‑region supplier list, no non‑sterile vs sterile split, and no per‑site throughput or validation timelines [[116]](#post-116) [[247]](#post-247) [[170]](#post-170) [[186]](#post-186) [[259]](#post-259). Near‑term, independent permit milestones and any Lilly‑published supply KPIs or an 8‑week dual‑site stress test would materially clarify whether the ≥1.8× ramp is locked, thereby de‑risking the volume‑led guidance.

## Lilly Direct and Digital Enablement: DTC Channel, Data Asset, and DTx Integration

LillyDirect is now a core commercial and data asset for Lilly’s incretin franchise. Management disclosed ~1.1M Q2 prescriptions routed through LillyDirect, with cash‑pay Zepbound vials around 20% of U.S. TRx and >35% of new starts—evidence that the DTC channel is cushioning formulary volatility and coverage gaps while employer opt‑ins remain partial. [[177]](#post-177) The CFO reiterated that LillyDirect functions as a hedge/bridge while payer coverage matures and is already contributing materially to performance. [[52]](#post-52)

The dominant perspective is to convert LillyDirect’s scale into payer‑grade real‑world evidence by publishing pre‑registered protocols, interoperability specifications, and transparent dashboards to accelerate formulary decisions and support outcomes‑based designs. Contributors also stress the need to embed equity metrics and consent standards into any RWE program. [[157]](#post-157) [[202]](#post-202) [[184]](#post-184) [[146]](#post-146) A countervailing view warns that without low‑barrier adaptations (phone enrollment, Medicaid billing, multilingual navigation, FQHC/340B links) and independent audits, a DTC‑heavy approach risks widening access gaps and political scrutiny.

### Analysis
The center of gravity favors operationalizing LillyDirect as a rigorous evidence engine—via pre‑registered RWE protocols, FHIR‑based data sharing, and public dashboards—to speed payer decisions and support outcomes contracts. The main tension is equity and governance: critics worry DTC reliance without low‑barrier adaptations and external audits could entrench access gaps and invite policy backlash. Key uncertainties include Lilly’s willingness to pre‑specify and publish analytic plans/interoperability artifacts, the depth of EMR/claims linkage, and the timeline for demographic/payer‑mix transparency—all pivotal to converting the channel’s scale into durable access and pricing leverage while maintaining trust.

## ESG and Equity: Environmental Footprint, Access Gaps, and Stigma Dynamics

Lilly’s scale-up to ≥1.8× sellable incretin doses makes environmental transparency and equitable access central to license-to-operate. On environment, the company has not published dose-level footprint metrics despite a rapid manufacturing ramp; investors worry about higher solvent/water use, hazardous waste, and GHGs, along with permitting and community-health risks. State permit filings offer interim, trackable proxies, but a third‑party life‑cycle assessment or plant-level design metrics are still absent. On equity, the LillyDirect cash/DTC strategy cushions coverage gaps yet risks excluding rural, low‑income, Medicaid, and non‑English-speaking populations without low‑barrier adaptations and transparent demographics. Several contributors recommend concrete mitigations: independent audits, KPI dashboards, and FQHC/340B partnerships. Psychosocial dynamics matter, too: rapid GLP‑1 adoption could worsen stigma for non‑users or those who regain weight, reinforcing the need for validated PROs and a payer‑grade monitoring protocol.

DTC price visibility also elevates policy exposure; regulators could push parity or tougher negotiations, making transparent access KPIs and credible equity pilots useful to defuse criticism and accelerate payer acceptance.

— ESG Fund Portfolio Manager; Support: 2

### Analysis
The dominant view is that environmental and equity disclosures lag the pace of scale-up and DTC expansion: investors want verifiable per‑dose footprint metrics and audited access KPIs, plus low‑barrier pilots to prevent exclusion. A minority argues Lilly’s governance systems can deliver these metrics on a defined roadmap. Key uncertainties: whether Lilly will publish dose‑level LCA/design metrics during the 1.8× ramp [[121]](#post-121), how quickly low‑barrier LillyDirect adaptations and FQHC/340B partnerships are operationalized [[228]](#post-228) [[272]](#post-272), and whether psychosocial risks from GLP‑1 normalization materialize—underscoring the value of prespecified PRO dashboards and safety thresholds [[105]](#post-105) [[224]](#post-224) [[268]](#post-268). Policy sensitivity to DTC price transparency remains a backdrop risk, strengthening the case for proactive equity and environmental disclosures [[99]](#post-99).

## Regulatory and Legal Exposures: Antitrust, Pricing Policy, Diagnostics, and Disclosure Risk

Regulatory exposures are a pivotal swing factor for Lilly’s incretin-led growth story. Three fronts matter most for investors: antitrust scrutiny from high U.S. incretin share combined with vertical integration (LillyDirect, manufacturing scale), pricing-policy risk amplified by visible DTC cash pricing, and disclosure/diagnostics risks that can shape label claims, payer behavior, and litigation exposure. Contributors see credible antitrust narratives given concentration and vertical moves, while noting that recent deals (SiteOne, Verve) are largely adjacent; near-term agency actions were absent as of the quarter, but the posture of U.S./foreign authorities remains an uncertainty to launch timing and remedies. [[113]](#post-113) [[203]](#post-203) [[119]](#post-119) [[158]](#post-158) [[232]](#post-232)

Policy risk is elevated by LillyDirect’s price transparency and obesity-politics dynamics (parity, IRA/MFN extensions), yet no explicit DTC–payer parity rule existed as of Aug 7, 2025. In neuroscience, diagnostic enablement is partially de‑risked by assay collaborations and label alignment but remains constrained by the lack of a widely covered, FDA‑cleared plasma p‑tau CDx and national coding/coverage—posing uptake and reimbursement friction. Finally, disclosure risks center on SURPASS‑CVOT’s unverified indirect cardioprotection claim and incomplete ATTAIN‑one SAP/estimand details; while no orforglipron‑related securities suits were filed as of the quarter, contributors argue for proactive transparency (SAPs, adjudication governance) to reduce litigation and reimbursement uncertainty.

> “Lilly’s 57%+ incretin share, recent buys (SiteOne, Verve) and vertical moves (Lilly Direct, scaling manufacturing) raise credible antitrust/remedy risk because high concentration plus vertical integration/foreclosure effects could prompt FTC/DOJ or foreign authority intervention, delaying launches or forcing divestitures [Status: INCONCLUSIVE].” [[113]](#post-113)  
— Healthcare Antitrust Attorney; Support: 8

> “SURPASS CVOT’s claim of cardioprotection rests on a pre-specified indirect matched comparison to putative placebo [Status: UNVERIFIED]; because there was no placebo arm, residual confounding, differing event definitions, and secular care differences can inflate apparent benefit—investors should demand patient‑level matching diagnostics, propensity overlap plots, and sensitivity analyses… before valuing an incremental survival benefit.” [[112]](#post-112)  
— Clinical Trials Auditor; Support: 19

> “Ask Lilly to publish a short, standardized dashboard: primary estimand(s)… missing‑data methods… discontinuation reasons/Ns; key subgroup effect sizes; pre‑specified sensitivity/tipping‑point analyses… because these items let investors and clinicians judge bias, informative missingness and heterogeneity.” [[191]](#post-191)  
— Science Communications Educator; Support: 20

> “No public securities‑class actions or SEC investigations tied to orforglipron were identified as of Aug 7, 2025 [Status: ABSENT]; because this gives Lilly a tactical window to remediate disclosure gaps (publish SAP/estimand and AE timing) and materially lowers immediate litigation‑reserve pressure, management can materially reduce near‑term legal tail risk by issuing targeted supplemental disclosures now.” [[225]](#post-225)  
— Securities Disclosure Risk Analyst; Support: 17

### Minority / Dissent

> “Payer/antitrust temperature check: HSR notifications (Verve) filed and no FTC/DOJ or foreign enforcement action was public as of Aug 7, 2025… because SiteOne/Verve are adjacent, likelihood of immediate structural remedies appears lower in the near term.” [[158]](#post-158)  
— Healthcare Antitrust Attorney; Support: 0

> “Lilly’s Roche/Quanterix collaborations and PI language requiring amyloid confirmation are a strength that should aid lab readiness and payer conversations… however, no publicly confirmed FDA‑cleared plasma p‑tau companion diagnostic nor clear national CPT/reimbursement pathway exists—could delay uptake.” [[192]](#post-192)  
— Medical Devices Regulatory Specialist; Support: 2

### Analysis
The dominant view flags real—but timing‑uncertain—regulatory exposures: potential antitrust scrutiny from high share/verticalization, pricing‑policy heat from DTC transparency, and disclosure/diagnostics frictions that can slow uptake or invite challenges. Dissent emphasizes that near‑term structural remedies look unlikely (adjacent deals; no actions filed) and that diagnostics risks are partly mitigated by collaborations and label alignment. The divergence reflects incomplete public evidence: agencies’ future posture, absence (so far) of detailed SURPASS matching diagnostics and ATTAIN SAPs, and a fluid policy environment without finalized parity mandates. Near‑term resolution hinges on EASD/journal transparency (estimands, indirect‑comparison methods), any agency signals on vertical conduct, and tangible CDx coverage progress—each directly shaping formulary leverage, label value, and litigation risk.

## Financial Outlook, Scenarios, and Optionality: Volume-Driven Growth vs Concentration Risk

Lilly’s FY25 raise (to $60–62B) and expanding margins reflect a volume-led story anchored in the incretin ramp and favorable mix, with non‑GAAP performance margin at 45.9% in Q2 and EPS of $6.31 supported by stronger volume and improved cost of production [[34]](#post-34) [[160]](#post-160) [[169]](#post-169). Management framed the growth as primarily volume‑driven rather than price, tied to producing at least 1.8× sellable incretin doses in 2025, but did not quantify the split of the guidance uplift among volume, price/mix, and M&A, leaving scenario attribution opaque [[110]](#post-110) [[118]](#post-118).

The core tension for investors is concentration and execution. Incretins comprised roughly 55% of Q2 revenue, and PBM dynamics (e.g., the CVS exclusion) plus cash‑channel competition may modulate growth and gross‑to‑net even as LillyDirect acts as a bridge; guidance and valuation thus hinge on delivering the ≥1.8× dose ramp while navigating payer/policy headwinds and disclosing enough operating and evidence transparency to sustain confidence [[160]](#post-160) [[114]](#post-114) [[52]](#post-52) [[64]](#post-64).

### Supporting Voices

> “Lilly's manufacturing ramp (1.6x sellable doses; guiding ≥1.8x) is a material strength—reducing supply risk and enabling faster global commercialization. Conversely, revenue concentration in incretins plus payer actions (CVS exclusion), cash-channel competition (compounding/Canadian generics) and potential international pricing reform create downside via fewer new starts and compressed net pricing [Status: INCONCLUSIVE].” [[114]](#post-114)  
— Sell‑side Pharma Equity Analyst; Support: 5

> “Recommend Lilly run and publish a concrete ‘proof‑of‑capacity’ stress test: two geographically‑separated qualified sites (internal or CMO) each sustain ≥25% of the incremental sellable‑dose target for 8 consecutive weeks, reporting weekly qualified‑batch counts and median lot‑release times to visibly de‑risk the 1.8× ramp for investors.” [[271]](#post-271)  
— Operations Director, API Manufacturing; Support: 20

> “Ask Lilly to publish a short, standardized dashboard: 6‑ and 12‑month real‑world adherence, primary‑care vs specialist initiation %, LillyDirect payer/demographic breakdown, and country‑level launch timelines—because transparent metrics will reduce investor uncertainty and counter misinformation [Status: UNKNOWN].” [[146]](#post-146)  
— Science Communications Educator; Support: 19

### Minority / Dissent

> “Lilly’s rapid onshore scale‑up (Research Triangle Park + two planned U.S. plants; 1.6→1.8× sellable‑dose target) is a material supply‑chain hedge because domestic capacity shortens lead times, enables buffer inventories and reduces exposure to overseas export controls/logistics shocks [Status: INCONCLUSIVE—impact yet to be realised].” [[141]](#post-141)  
— Global Supply Chain Specialist; Support: 4

### Analysis
The dominant perspective backs the volume‑led upside but conditions it on verifiable execution and transparency: capacity proof points and operating KPIs to underwrite the ≥1.8× ramp; investor dashboards to cut uncertainty; and vigilance on concentration‑driven exposures (PBM actions, cash‑channel competition, pricing reforms) [[114]](#post-114) [[271]](#post-271) [[198]](#post-198) [[146]](#post-146). The minority view argues onshoring already provides a structural hedge, downplaying ramp risk [[141]](#post-141). Key uncertainties remain: whether Lilly hits the ≥1.8× target, how CVS and broader payer moves influence TRx slope and net price, and how much of guidance is truly volume‑driven given the absence of a quantified component split or management stress‑tests for policy shocks [[110]](#post-110) [[118]](#post-118) [[64]](#post-64) [[281]](#post-281).

## Global Rollout and APAC Market Access: Pricing, Distribution, and Localization

Oral small‑molecule GLP‑1s create a plausible APAC access wedge by avoiding injectable cold‑chain and in‑clinic administration, enabling primary‑care initiation, tiered pricing, local manufacturing partnerships, and volume‑based tenders. The commercial logic is that lower per‑patient delivery costs plus cardiometabolic benefits can improve ICERs and budget‑impact dossiers for national payers and procurement authorities. [[148]](#post-148) [[193]](#post-193) [[222]](#post-222)

However, as of August 7, 2025 there were no country‑level APAC launch plans, HTA/tender submissions, or national reimbursement listings for orforglipron or other oral obesity medicines publicly disclosed, underscoring an execution gap between theoretical pathway and realized access. Unlocking APAC will likely depend on timely regulatory filings, payer‑grade value dossiers leveraging SURPASS/ATTAIN signals, and dependable supply—areas where public granularity is limited. [[115]](#post-115) [[279]](#post-279) [[181]](#post-181)

### Supporting Voices

> “Orforglipron’s once‑daily oral format creates a pragmatic APAC adoption pathway: payers running cost‑sensitive, primary‑care NCD programs can more readily include an oral obesity medicine in national formularies/tenders because it avoids injection cold‑chain, clinic administration and specialist routing → lowers total care cost per patient and enables tiered pricing plus local manufacturing partnerships to secure volume and faster reimbursement.” [[148]](#post-148)  
— Market Access Consultant (Asia‑Pacific); Support: 0

> “Orforglipron’s oral, cold‑chain‑free profile creates a concrete APAC market‑access pathway—because avoiding injectable cold‑chain and clinic administration lowers total per‑patient delivery costs, national payers can adopt volume‑based tenders and primary‑care inclusion with tiered pricing to rapidly scale access and meet constrained budgets.” [[193]](#post-193)  
— Market Access Consultant (Asia‑Pacific); Support: 0

> “Lilly can translate oral orforglipron’s low‑distribution burden plus SURPASS‑CVOT/ATTAIN cardiometabolic benefits into APAC HTA value dossiers and volume‑based tender offers—because lower per‑patient delivery costs combined with projected reductions in CV events improve ICERs and fiscal impact, easing national payer reimbursement and primary‑care scale‑up.” [[222]](#post-222)  
— Market Access Consultant (Asia‑Pacific); Support: 0

> “Orforglipron’s oral small‑molecule chemistry likely shortens global scale‑up lead times vs sterile injectables—because tablet/solid‑dose lines and standard fill‑pack capacity are more numerous, lower‑cost, and avoid cold‑chain/fill‑finish chokepoints; recommend investors monitor 'non‑sterile dose %' and 'regional time‑to‑first‑release' as resilience KPIs.” [[227]](#post-227)  
— Operations Director, API Manufacturing; Support: 0

### Minority / Dissent

> “Short answer: No — I found no public, country-level APAC launch plans, early prescription figures, or primary‑care vs specialist prescribing‑share metrics from Eli Lilly as of August 7, 2025.” [[115]](#post-115)  
— Market Access Consultant (Asia‑Pacific); Support: 0

— Market Access Consultant (Asia‑Pacific); Support: 0

### Analysis
The dominant view emphasizes the structural fit of an oral GLP‑1 for APAC—lower distribution/admin costs, primary‑care enablement, and tender‑friendly economics—augmented by cardiometabolic value claims. The counterpoint is purely evidentiary and timing‑based: no APAC filings, launches, or listings are public yet, so the path remains theoretical. Key uncertainties are (a) when dossiers will be filed and how HTA bodies weigh SURPASS/ATTAIN signals in local ICERs, (b) whether Lilly can demonstrate reliable non‑sterile supply and regional time‑to‑release, and (c) the pace of national tender adoption and tiered‑pricing negotiations across diverse APAC systems.

## Emerging Clusters & Factions

Eight distinct clusters emerged, spanning payer access skeptics, methods‑first transparency advocates, operations/supply realists, ESG/equity accountability voices, DTC/RWE acceleration builders, growth‑optionalists, regulatory/legal risk monitors, and APAC rollout pragmatists. The debate’s spine is clear: volume‑driven growth and oral expansion are compelling, but realization depends on payer evidence thresholds, manufacturing execution, and transparent disclosures that withstand regulatory and policy scrutiny.

### **Cluster 1: Payer Gatekeepers and Access Skeptics**

- Expect PBMs to blunt orforglipron uptake via prior authorization, step edits, and BMI/comorbidity thresholds; employer opt‑ins remain slow, and formulary shocks (e.g., CVS exclusion) can temper TRx slope and force net‑price concessions. [[92]](#post-92) [[297]](#post-297) [[129]](#post-129) [[114]](#post-114)  
- Advocate evidence‑gated coverage (oral‑first pilots with 12‑month RWE thresholds) and sequenced/maintenance pricing to cap budget risk and broaden access over time. [[211]](#post-211) [[255]](#post-255) [[240]](#post-240)  
- Key voices: Healthcare Payer Analyst – Health Policy Strategist – Institutional Pharma Sales Rep

### **Cluster 2: Methods‑First Transparency Coalition**

- Demand ATTAIN‑1 SAP/estimand and missing‑data methods, subgroup and sensitivity outputs, hepatic adjudication details; without this, informative dropout and “no hepatic signal” claims remain uncertain. [[104]](#post-104) [[231]](#post-231) [[223]](#post-223)  
- Treat SURPASS‑CVOT’s indirect “putative placebo” comparison as unverified pending patient‑level matching diagnostics and robustness checks; call for standardized trial‑statistics dashboards and data access. [[112]](#post-112) [[191]](#post-191) [[269]](#post-269) [[294]](#post-294)  
- Key voices: Clinical Trials Auditor – Science Communications Educator – Bioethicist

### **Cluster 3: Operations & Supply Realists**

- View the ≥1.8× dose‑ramp as execution‑critical but exposed to API/excipient concentration, sterile fill–finish slots, tech‑transfer/qualification lags, and inland‑logistics shocks; seek public supply KPIs and dual‑site “proof‑of‑capacity.” [[108]](#post-108) [[96]](#post-96) [[186]](#post-186) [[259]](#post-259) [[198]](#post-198) [[271]](#post-271)  
- Acknowledge onshoring as a hedge but note absent granular supplier maps or non‑sterile vs sterile splits to validate resilience. [[141]](#post-141) [[116]](#post-116) [[247]](#post-247)  
- Key voices: Operations Director, API Manufacturing – Global Supply Chain Specialist

### **Cluster 4: ESG & Equity Accountability Bloc**

- Warn LillyDirect/cash‑vial models can exclude rural, low‑income, non‑English and Medicaid patients; push for phone enrollment, multilingual navigation, FQHC/340B pilots, and independent equity audits with published KPIs. [[109]](#post-109) [[199]](#post-199) [[228]](#post-228) [[272]](#post-272) [[274]](#post-274)  
- Press for dose‑level environmental metrics and third‑party LCAs during the ramp; use state permits as interim proxies and advocate comp‑linked ESG KPIs. [[121]](#post-121) [[107]](#post-107) [[197]](#post-197) [[226]](#post-226) [[270]](#post-270) [[230]](#post-230)  
- Key voices: ESG Fund Portfolio Manager – Community Health Organizer – Environmental Impact Assessor – Behavioral Health Researcher

### **Cluster 5: DTC/RWE Acceleration Builders**

- Convert LillyDirect’s scale into payer‑grade RWE via pre‑registered protocols, FHIR datasets, and equity‑stratified dashboards; propose DTx‑pairing and employer/hospital pragmatic pilots to boost persistence and speed access. [[157]](#post-157) [[202]](#post-202) [[184]](#post-184) [[139]](#post-139) [[213]](#post-213) [[219]](#post-219) [[263]](#post-263) [[257]](#post-257)  
- Key voices: Health Data Scientist – Chief Technology Officer, HealthTech – Institutional Pharma Sales Rep

### **Cluster 6: Growth‑Optionality & Outcomes Monetizers**

- Emphasize durable growth optionality (Verve one‑time genetic therapies, SiteOne pain, oral GLP‑1 plus capacity and LillyDirect) and financial resilience (margins, cash returns). [[93]](#post-93) [[183]](#post-183) [[159]](#post-159) [[151]](#post-151)  
- Seek to monetize SURPASS‑CVOT/ATTAIN signals via outcomes‑based contracts (e.g., MACE reduction) and defend net price amid formulary pressure; maintain an allocator playbook with data‑driven triggers. [[137]](#post-137) [[204]](#post-204) [[144]](#post-144) [[277]](#post-277)  
- Key voices: Venture Partner, Biotech – Sell‑side Pharma Equity Analyst – Institutional Asset Allocator – Actuary

### **Cluster 7: Regulatory & Legal Guardrails**

- Flag antitrust risk from high incretin share plus vertical moves (LillyDirect, manufacturing) and policy exposure from visible DTC pricing; note near‑term relief where deals are adjacent and no actions are public. [[113]](#post-113) [[203]](#post-203) [[158]](#post-158) [[232]](#post-232) [[99]](#post-99)  
- Urge proactive disclosure to curb securities‑litigation risk (publish SAPs, adjudication governance) and accelerate diagnostics coverage for donanemab (CDx pathways). [[225]](#post-225) [[192]](#post-192) [[221]](#post-221) [[210]](#post-210)  
- Key voices: Healthcare Antitrust Attorney – Securities Litigation Analyst – Medical Devices Regulatory Specialist – Health Policy Strategist

### **Cluster 8: Global Rollout Pragmatists (APAC)**

- Argue oral small‑molecule GLP‑1s fit APAC tender and primary‑care models (no cold‑chain/admin burden) and can pair with tiered pricing and local manufacturing; supply reliability and dossiers are prerequisites. [[148]](#post-148) [[193]](#post-193) [[222]](#post-222) [[227]](#post-227)  
- Note absence of public APAC filings, launch plans or HTA wins to date—execution remains theoretical pending submissions and capacity proof. [[115]](#post-115) [[181]](#post-181) [[279]](#post-279)  
- Key voices: Market Access Consultant (Asia‑Pacific) – Global Supply Chain Specialist

### **Analysis**

#### **Convergences**
- Evidence is the currency for access: clusters 1, 2, and 5 align on the need for prespecified SAPs and payer‑grade RWE (protocols, dashboards) to unlock coverage and value‑based models. [[231]](#post-231) [[112]](#post-112) [[157]](#post-157) [[202]](#post-202) [[211]](#post-211)  
- The ≥1.8× dose ramp is the core earnings lever; operations and growth‑optionalists agree capacity proof points and KPIs would materially de‑risk the financial thesis. [[110]](#post-110) [[198]](#post-198) [[271]](#post-271)  
- LillyDirect is strategic but must be governed: DTC/RWE builders and ESG/equity voices both call for transparency, interoperability, and equity adaptations (plus audits) to sustain trust. [[157]](#post-157) [[184]](#post-184) [[109]](#post-109) [[274]](#post-274)  
- SURPASS/ATTAIN signals can be monetized via outcomes contracts; payer gatekeepers and growth‑optionalists converge on outcomes‑tied pathways if evidence is robust. [[137]](#post-137) [[204]](#post-204) [[211]](#post-211)

#### **Fault‑Lines**
- Payer friction vs. pricing resilience: access skeptics foresee step edits and net‑price pressure, whereas growth‑optionalists expect outcomes constructs and channel flexibility to defend value. [[92]](#post-92) [[114]](#post-114) [[144]](#post-144) [[155]](#post-155)  
- Interpreting cardioprotection: methods‑first voices caution against valuing SURPASS indirect comparisons without diagnostics; monetizers view them as near‑term formulary levers. [[112]](#post-112) [[137]](#post-137)  
- Ramp risk posture: supply realists highlight multi‑node bottlenecks and validation lags; onshoring advocates downplay risk without publishing detailed supplier/capacity splits. [[96]](#post-96) [[108]](#post-108) [[186]](#post-186) vs. [[141]](#post-141)  
- DTC equity/policy exposure: ESG/equity bloc warns of exclusion and political backlash absent audits and low‑barrier adaptations; DTC/RWE builders stress speed to evidence and access. [[109]](#post-109) [[274]](#post-274) vs. [[157]](#post-157) [[139]](#post-139)  
- Environmental disclosure urgency: ESG voices seek dose‑level LCAs now; others note corporate frameworks exist but lack product‑level metrics during ramp. [[121]](#post-121) [[107]](#post-107) [[152]](#post-152) vs. [[201]](#post-201)

## Recommendations

Widely Supported
* Underwrite tirzepatide’s CV value conservatively until full SURPASS‑CVOT methods are public — treat non‑inferiority vs dulaglutide as base and defer incremental cardioprotection credit until patient‑level matching diagnostics and sensitivity analyses (overlap plots, E‑values, alternative matchers) are released at/after EASD [[205]](#post-205) [[112]](#post-112) [[134]](#post-134) [[180]](#post-180).
* Require ATTAIN‑1 methods transparency before valuing orforglipron’s efficacy at parity with injectables — insist on the full SAP, primary estimand, and missing‑data rules plus sensitivity/tipping‑point outputs; treat placebo‑vs‑active discontinuation deltas and “no hepatic signal” claims as unresolved until hepatic monitoring/adjudication details are disclosed [[104]](#post-104) [[231]](#post-231) [[243]](#post-243) [[223]](#post-223) [[191]](#post-191).
* Center the 2025 model on volume — the ≥1.8× sellable‑dose target is the key earnings driver; track evidence of ramp via any published supply KPIs or stress‑tests and use state permit milestones as commissioning proxies; haircut if tech‑transfer/inspection or supplier/logistics risks surface or if ramp proof remains absent by Q4 [[110]](#post-110) [[198]](#post-198) [[271]](#post-271) [[215]](#post-215) [[226]](#post-226) [[186]](#post-186) [[96]](#post-96) [[108]](#post-108).
* Bake in payer friction for orforglipron — assume prior‑auth, BMI/comorbidity thresholds and step therapy on launch; monitor PBM policy postings and CVS‑related drag on Zepbound new starts to calibrate early orforglipron uptake and gross‑to‑net assumptions [[297]](#post-297) [[129]](#post-129) [[92]](#post-92) [[64]](#post-64) [[114]](#post-114).
* Use LillyDirect as a resilience signal but discount until it’s an evidence engine — acknowledge ≈1.1M Q2 TRx and cash‑vial mix but condition faster coverage/pricing assumptions on Lilly publishing a pre‑registered RWE plan, minimal FHIR dataset, and adherence/outcomes dashboards; otherwise, maintain slower access scenarios [[177]](#post-177) [[52]](#post-52) [[157]](#post-157) [[202]](#post-202) [[184]](#post-184) [[146]](#post-146).
* Explicitly model employer coverage as steady, not step‑function — with opt‑ins at ~50–55% and management positioning LillyDirect as a bridge, keep cash‑channel share in place until new plan designs or evidence‑gated pilots are publicly adopted [[29]](#post-29) [[52]](#post-52) [[211]](#post-211).
* Treat diagnostics as a gating factor for donanemab — absent an FDA‑cleared plasma p‑tau CDx with coding/coverage, assume PET‑led identification and slower broad uptake; monitor assay collaborations but don’t accelerate adoption curves without coverage progress [[192]](#post-192) [[210]](#post-210) [[172]](#post-172).
* Keep regulatory/antitrust risk on the radar but don’t price near‑term remedies — Verve cleared HSR early and SiteOne is adjacent; reassess if agencies open actions tied to LillyDirect verticalization or incretin share [[158]](#post-158) [[119]](#post-119) [[203]](#post-203) [[113]](#post-113) [[232]](#post-232).
* Demand financial clarity — management didn’t split the guidance raise by volume vs price/mix/M&A; run independent scenario bands and ask for policy‑shock stress tests (parity, IRA/MFN, PBM exclusions) before expanding multiples on guidance alone [[118]](#post-118) [[281]](#post-281) [[34]](#post-34) [[114]](#post-114).
* Incorporate ESG execution risk into the ramp — use public permit proxies to build interim per‑dose environmental KPIs; treat absent dose‑level LCA/mitigation metrics as a modest multiple drag during capacity expansion [[121]](#post-121) [[197]](#post-197) [[226]](#post-226) [[270]](#post-270) [[111]](#post-111).
* Use the allocator trigger playbook — modest overweight now with data‑driven adjustments: reduce if major PBMs issue oral‑first exclusions or net price erodes >10% y/y; raise if EASD/peer‑review confirms ITT/MMRM with no hepatic signal; cut if the ≥1.8× ramp misses Q4 delivery [[277]](#post-277).

Experimental / Watch-list
* Outcomes‑based contracts on MACE/all‑cause mortality — upside if payers publicly adopt SURPASS‑anchored outcomes guarantees; keep as optionality until named deals and terms (endpoints, windows, adjustments) are announced [[137]](#post-137) [[204]](#post-204) [[166]](#post-166).
* Evidence‑gated oral‑first pilots — monitor for PBMs adopting time‑limited orforglipron coverage conditioned on 12‑month RWE thresholds (persistence, weight/A1c); do not assume near‑term savings or faster access without explicit payer pilots [[211]](#post-211) [[182]](#post-182) [[240]](#post-240).
* Sequenced induction→maintenance pricing — treat “tirzepatide induction then orforglipron maintenance” as non‑core upside; model only upon signed payer agreements with responder thresholds and switch rules [[255]](#post-255) [[284]](#post-284).
* Digital‑therapeutic pairing via LillyDirect — watch for randomized or pragmatic pilots (AI‑guided titration, proactive GI management) that could boost 12‑month persistence and reduce total cost; value only after protocol and interim results are public [[139]](#post-139) [[213]](#post-213) [[176]](#post-176) [[242]](#post-242).
* Low‑barrier access pilots and equity audit — potential reputational and access upside if LillyDirect adds phone enrollment, Medicaid billing, multilingual navigation, and FQHC/340B pilots backed by independent audits; until then, maintain an equity/policy overhang in risk ratings [[228]](#post-228) [[272]](#post-272) [[199]](#post-199) [[274]](#post-274) [[246]](#post-246) [[280]](#post-280) [[130]](#post-130).
* APAC oral‑first tenders — optional growth vector if country submissions/HTA wins materialize; hold back regional revenue until filings and national reimbursement decisions are public [[148]](#post-148) [[193]](#post-193) [[222]](#post-222) [[115]](#post-115) [[181]](#post-181) [[279]](#post-279).
* Environmental LCA disclosure — monitor for dose‑level lifecycle metrics or plant‑design targets; a credible third‑party LCA could reduce ESG discount during the ramp [[121]](#post-121) [[125]](#post-125) [[152]](#post-152) [[201]](#post-201).
* Capacity “proof‑of‑capacity” release — if Lilly publishes dual‑site 8‑week batch counts and lot‑release times, remove a portion of the execution discount on the ≥1.8× ramp; absent data, retain caution on 2H throughput [[271]](#post-271) [[293]](#post-293).
* Donanemab plasma CDx pathway — upside to adoption curves if FDA‑cleared plasma p‑tau CDx and CMS coding/coverage land; track for FDA–CMS parallel‑review signals and payer coverage notices [[221]](#post-221) [[265]](#post-265) [[210]](#post-210) [[295]](#post-295).
* Insurer/reinsurer actuarial adoption — watch for published microsimulations translating SURPASS/ATTAIN into reserve/annuity adjustments; broader payer recognition of longevity/MACE impacts could catalyze outcomes contracts and coverage expansion [[217]](#post-217) [[261]](#post-261) [[239]](#post-239) [[128]](#post-128) [[188]](#post-188).

## Expert Network Questions

### **Profile 1 – Cardiometabolic Trial Statistician (estimands, indirect comparisons, hepatic safety)**
- For ATTAIN‑1, what primary estimand and treatment‑policy vs efficacy framing would be most credible to payers, and which missing‑data methods (MMRM vs MI with delta adjustments) should be pre‑specified to neutralize informative dropout?
- How large could bias be from the observed discontinuation gap (≈30% placebo vs ≈22–24% active) under plausible missing‑not‑at‑random scenarios, and which tipping‑point analyses would quantify robustness?
- What minimum transparency package should be in the EASD/journal release to satisfy payer/investor scrutiny: ITT and treatment‑regimen side‑by‑side, discontinuation reason/time‑to‑event curves, and AE onset timing?
- For hepatic safety, what LFT monitoring cadence, Hy’s‑Law thresholds, blinded adjudication process, and post‑treatment follow‑up duration are needed to credibly rule out idiosyncratic DILI at the ATTAIN‑1 sample size?
- In SURPASS‑CVOT’s putative‑placebo indirect comparison, which patient‑level matching approach (e.g., IPTW/MAIC/PSM) and diagnostics (overlap plots, SMDs) are necessary, and how would you present E‑values/negative‑control outcomes to bound unmeasured confounding?
- How should event‑definition harmonization differences between trials be handled in matched analyses to avoid biasing MACE/all‑cause mortality estimates?
- Which subgroup analyses (race/ethnicity, age bands, SES proxies, key comorbidities) are decision‑critical, and what minimum cell counts/width of CIs would you demand before interpreting heterogeneity?
- What pre‑registered RWE emulation (endpoints, windows, causal adjustment plan) using LillyDirect + claims/EMR would best complement ATTAIN/SURPASS for payer decisions, and how would you mitigate selection bias inherent to a telehealth/cash channel?

### **Profile 2 – Pharma Manufacturing/CMC Operations Leader (incretin scale‑up, CDMO, inspections)**
- Decompose the critical path from ~1.6× to ≥1.8× sellable doses: which unit operations (API synthesis/purification, device assembly, fill–finish, QC release) are most likely to bottleneck in 2H and why?
- What dual‑sourcing thresholds for APIs, key excipients, and primary packaging would materially de‑risk single‑point failure, and how can a sponsor evidence multi‑source readiness without revealing supplier identities?
- Design a credible public “proof‑of‑capacity” stress test: which sites, weekly qualified‑batch metrics, and median lot‑release times would independently validate the incremental throughput for 8 consecutive weeks?
- What realistic tech‑transfer/PPQ/inspection timelines can newly commissioned U.S. lines achieve if they aim to contribute meaningful commercial batches before year‑end, and where do timelines most often slip?
- Which supply KPIs (e.g., API inventory days, fill–finish slot utilization, qualified batches/week, lot‑release backlog, OOS/rework rates) are decision‑useful for investors without compromising competitive or GMP sensitivities?
- How quickly can non‑sterile solid‑dose (orforglipron) capacity offset sterile‑injectable chokepoints at the portfolio level, and what constraints (granulation, compression, coating, packaging) typically emerge?
- What inland‑logistics contingencies (dual carriers, pre‑booked chassis/rail, hurricane reroutes) should be pre‑built for RTP/Indiana/Houston, and what lead indicators would trigger mode shifts or buffer inventory draws?
- Which environmental permit milestones (air VOC caps, water allocations, NPDES limits) most commonly delay commissioning, and what engineering mitigations (solvent recovery, water reuse) can be credibly pre‑committed to keep schedules on track?

### **Profile 3 – PBM/Formulary Strategy Executive (GLP‑1 management, outcomes contracts, DTC data)**
- At launch of an oral GLP‑1, what default PA/step‑therapy criteria and BMI+comorbidity thresholds would you implement, and what 12‑month evidence would trigger relaxation (or tightening)?
- Would you pilot an “oral‑first, evidence‑gate” policy with pre‑set thresholds (e.g., ≥60% 12‑month persistence, ≥10% placebo‑adjusted weight loss, ≥1% A1c in T2D)? What data‑sharing, audit rights, and enforcement mechanics are non‑negotiable?
- Does SURPASS‑CVOT (non‑inferiority vs GLP‑1 + indirect cardioprotection) justify preferential tiering/net price for tirzepatide? What matched‑analysis diagnostics and sensitivity checks must be delivered before underwriting a MACE‑linked outcomes contract?
- How would you structure a 6‑ to 12‑month outcomes guarantee for obesity (persistence/weight‑loss thresholds) to satisfy employer CFOs—define measurement windows, attribution rules, and rebate/clawback formulas?
- Under what conditions would you endorse an induction→maintenance sequence (tirzepatide induction, orforglipron maintenance)? Specify responder thresholds, switch windows, and operational guardrails to prevent gaming.
- What minimal LillyDirect dataset (FHIR elements, cadence) would you require to use DTC‑sourced RWE in utilization‑management decisions, and how would you address selection bias from telehealth/cash channels?
- How do template‑formulary exclusions (e.g., CVS decisions) propagate to self‑insured clients, and what contract levers (rebate guarantees, outcomes riders) would reverse such exclusions mid‑cycle?
- What policy or political triggers (e.g., parity mandates, IRA/MFN expansions, public DTC price scrutiny) would cause you to reprice or re‑tier GLP‑1s within 12–24 months, and how do you hedge that risk in current agreements?

## Top Reinforced Points & Network Propagation

### “Proof‑of‑capacity” Stress Test

> “<add: [Strength] Recommend Lilly run and publish a concrete "proof‑of‑capacity" stress test: two geographically‑separated qualified sites (internal or CMO) each sustain ≥25% of the incremental sellable‑dose target for 8 consecutive weeks, reporting weekly qualified‑batch counts and median lot‑release times to visibly de‑risk the 1.8× ramp for investors [Status: UNKNOWN] | Falsifier: publish 8‑week dual‑site batch data {Conf: Med}>” [[271]](#post-271)

## Materiality & Impact Assessment

### **Theme 1 — Orforglipron Market Access and Payer Dynamics: Coverage, Cash Channels, and Value-Based Contracts**

#### **Scale**
- Material to near‑ and mid‑term growth: orforglipron’s oral, once‑daily profile can unlock new patient segments and primary‑care channels, with modeled upside of roughly $2–4B at 5–10% first‑year TRx share under current performance‑margin/tax assumptions; payer placement remains the key unknown [[155]](#post-155), [[138]](#post-138), [[97]](#post-97), [[101]](#post-101).
- Downside risk from payer controls (prior auth, BMI/comorbidity thresholds, step therapy, narrow formularies) that can suppress starts and compress net price [[92]](#post-92), [[297]](#post-297), [[129]](#post-129).
- DTC/cash remains a meaningful bridge: ≈1.1M Q2 prescriptions via LillyDirect; Zepbound cash vials ≈20% of TRx and >35% of new starts—showing channel leverage while employer opt‑ins (~50–55%) remain steady [[177]](#post-177), [[52]](#post-52), [[29]](#post-29).

#### **Timing**
- Immediate to 2026: class‑level UM criteria already exist; CVS exclusion is already a headwind to near‑term growth rate (Q3) [[297]](#post-297), [[64]](#post-64).
- Evidence conversion window: ATTAIN/SURPASS full presentations at EASD 2025 are near‑term catalysts for contracting and coverage; Lilly targets submissions by year‑end 2025 [[180]](#post-180), [[244]](#post-244), [[23]](#post-23), [[45]](#post-45).

#### **Dependencies**
- Payers maintain standard GLP‑1 UM (BMI ≥30 or ≥27 with comorbidity; documented lifestyle trial; reauth thresholds) and do not institute oral‑first exclusions that materially shrink initial access windows [[297]](#post-297).
- Lilly publishes payer‑grade RWE plans/dashboards (pre‑registered analyses, endpoints, methods, equity stratification) to support coverage decisions [[157]](#post-157), [[202]](#post-202), [[184]](#post-184), [[146]](#post-146).
- Lilly sustains ≥1.8× sellable‑dose ramp to support uptake without stockouts or channel rationing [[110]](#post-110).
- Outcomes‑based constructs (e.g., MACE‑linked, evidence‑gated oral‑first pilots) gain payer adoption following EASD publications [[137]](#post-137), [[204]](#post-204), [[211]](#post-211), [[166]](#post-166).

#### **Net Impact**
- Ambiguous. Upside from oral convenience and DTC scale is real, but near‑term slope and gross‑to‑net are sensitive to PBM controls (including template‑level exclusions), employer adoption pace, and the speed/quality of evidence transparency and RWE delivery [[92]](#post-92), [[64]](#post-64), [[29]](#post-29), [[157]](#post-157).

---

### **Theme 2 — Evidence Quality and Clinical Interpretability: ATTAIN-one Estimands, SURPASS-CVOT Indirectness, and Subgroup Transparency**

#### **Scale**
- High strategic and pricing impact: ATTAIN‑one’s undisclosed SAP/missing‑data rules amidst differential discontinuation (placebo 29.9% vs 22–24% active) can bias efficacy if missingness is informative; SURPASS‑CVOT’s cardioprotection claim relies on an unverified indirect, matched analysis to putative placebo—core to payer valuation and outcomes contracting [[104]](#post-104), [[231]](#post-231), [[112]](#post-112), [[205]](#post-205).
- Disclosure gaps (hepatic monitoring/adjudication; DSMB/CEC charters) elevate scrutiny and potential litigation narratives [[223]](#post-223), [[294]](#post-294), [[225]](#post-225).

#### **Timing**
- Immediate: EASD 2025 is the first opportunity to resolve methods and governance gaps; ACHIEVE‑1 NEJM supplement provides precedent for estimand/method transparency [[180]](#post-180), [[244]](#post-244), [[208]](#post-208).

#### **Dependencies**
  - Publish ATTAIN‑1 SAP with primary estimand and missing‑data methods; include ITT vs treatment‑regimen results, sensitivity/tipping‑point analyses, discontinuation reasons/timing [[231]](#post-231), [[243]](#post-243), [[191]](#post-191).
  - Release hepatic‑safety monitoring cadence, Hy’s‑Law criteria, and hepatic‑adjudication charter/follow‑up details [[223]](#post-223).
  - Provide SURPASS‑CVOT patient‑level matching diagnostics (overlap plots, SMDs) and sensitivity analyses (E‑values, alternative matchers) for the indirect comparison [[112]](#post-112), [[134]](#post-134).
  - Enable controlled access to de‑identified datasets (e.g., Vivli) post‑publication/regulatory milestones [[298]](#post-298), [[269]](#post-269).

#### **Net Impact**
- Ambiguous until disclosures land. Payers may discount efficacy and cardioprotection claims absent SAP‑level transparency and robust indirect‑comparison diagnostics; proactive publication can mitigate securities‑risk and accelerate coverage [[112]](#post-112), [[104]](#post-104), [[225]](#post-225).

---

### **Theme 3 — Manufacturing Scale-Up and Supply Chain Resilience: Delivering the 1.8x Dose Ramp**

#### **Scale**
- Central to FY25 delivery: management guided to ≥1.8× incretin sellable doses in 2025 after >1.6× in 1H; revenue and EPS are volume‑led, with margin leverage from mix/fixed‑cost absorption [[34]](#post-34), [[110]](#post-110).
- Execution risks: API/excipient single‑source exposure, sterile fill–finish capacity, tech‑transfer/qualification/inspections, and inland‑logistics weather/crew constraints; mitigation via internal/on‑shore builds and multiple CDMOs is claimed but not mapped publicly [[108]](#post-108), [[96]](#post-96), [[186]](#post-186), [[259]](#post-259), [[153]](#post-153), [[200]](#post-200), [[141]](#post-141).

#### **Timing**
- Immediate through 2H‑2025: RTP ramp already contributing; two new U.S. plant locations to be named “later this quarter”; inspection/PPQ timing is a potential month‑to‑quarter bottleneck [[23]](#post-23), [[186]](#post-186).
- Near‑term monitoring via state permit milestones and proxies while dose‑level capacity maps are absent [[215]](#post-215), [[197]](#post-197), [[226]](#post-226).

#### **Dependencies**
  - Dual/multi‑sourcing of critical APIs/excipients, assured fill–finish slots; timely tech‑transfer, PPQ, and FDA/EMA inspections [[108]](#post-108), [[96]](#post-96), [[186]](#post-186).
  - Operational transparency (supply KPIs) and/or an 8‑week, dual‑site “proof‑of‑capacity” publication to validate throughput [[198]](#post-198), [[271]](#post-271).
  - Inland‑logistics contingencies to mitigate hurricane/rail/carrier constraints [[259]](#post-259).
  - Permit issuance and compliance to avoid commissioning delays [[215]](#post-215), [[197]](#post-197), [[226]](#post-226).

#### **Net Impact**
- Positive if achieved; execution risk remains meaningful given concentrated inputs, validation timelines, and logistics. Absent public KPIs or stress‑tests, investors should treat the ramp as a key sensitivity to FY25 volume and margin realization [[110]](#post-110), [[198]](#post-198), [[271]](#post-271).

---

### **Theme 4 — Lilly Direct and Digital Enablement: DTC Channel, Data Asset, and DTx Integration**

#### **Scale**
- Already material: ≈1.1M Q2 TRx routed via LillyDirect; cash vials ~20% of Zepbound TRx and >35% of new starts; CFO frames LillyDirect as a performance contributor and a hedge while coverage matures [[177]](#post-177), [[52]](#post-52).
- Evidence engine potential: pre‑registered RWE protocols, FHIR datasets, and equity‑stratified dashboards could materially de‑risk payer decisions and accelerate formulary access [[157]](#post-157), [[202]](#post-202), [[184]](#post-184), [[146]](#post-146).
- Data‑sharing specifics and agreements are not publicly detailed, limiting immediate payer utility [[120]](#post-120).

#### **Timing**
- Immediate: channel volumes and cash access visible in Q2; 12‑month RWE gates for coverage pilots can be designed now but require pre‑specification and linkage infrastructure [[177]](#post-177), [[211]](#post-211), [[202]](#post-202).

#### **Dependencies**
  - Publish a payer‑grade RWE plan (endpoints, estimands, missing‑data rules), minimal FHIR dataset, and dashboards (adherence, discontinuation, initiation mix, demographics) [[157]](#post-157), [[202]](#post-202), [[184]](#post-184), [[146]](#post-146).
  - Demonstrate EMR/claims linkage and acceptable consent/data‑use governance for payer reliance [[120]](#post-120), [[157]](#post-157).
  - Maintain supply availability (≥1.8× ramp) to sustain DTC’s role in access bridging [[110]](#post-110).

#### **Net Impact**
- Positive strategically; tempered by evidence‑readiness and equity/policy exposure. Without published RWE protocols and demographic/payer‑mix transparency, payers may limit reliance and regulators may scrutinize the channel’s role in pricing/access [[157]](#post-157), [[184]](#post-184), [[99]](#post-99).

---

### **Theme 5 — ESG and Equity: Environmental Footprint, Access Gaps, and Stigma Dynamics**

#### **Scale**
- Environmental disclosures lag the scale‑up: no dose‑level footprint for the ≥1.8× ramp; solvent, water, waste, and GHG increases can elevate permitting, community‑health, and reputational risk; state permits offer interim proxies investors can track [[121]](#post-121), [[111]](#post-111), [[107]](#post-107), [[197]](#post-197), [[226]](#post-226), [[270]](#post-270).
- Access equity risk: DTC/cash model can exclude rural, low‑income, non‑English and Medicaid populations without low‑barrier adaptations; Lilly has not published demographic/payer‑mix breakdowns or an independent equity audit [[109]](#post-109), [[130]](#post-130), [[274]](#post-274).
- Psychosocial dynamics of GLP‑1 uptake are uncertain; monitoring could create payer‑relevant ROI evidence [[105]](#post-105), [[224]](#post-224), [[195]](#post-195).

#### **Timing**
- Immediate (2025 ramp and DTC expansion): corporate frameworks exist, enabling near‑term KPI publication if prioritized [[201]](#post-201).
- Medium‑term: third‑party LCA and verified equity audits could be delivered on a 6–12‑month roadmap [[274]](#post-274), [[152]](#post-152), [[201]](#post-201).

#### **Dependencies**
  - Publish dose‑level environmental metrics or third‑party LCA and show greenfield design choices (solvent recovery, continuous flow) [[121]](#post-121), [[125]](#post-125), [[152]](#post-152).
  - Maintain permit progress and compliance to avoid commissioning delays [[215]](#post-215), [[197]](#post-197), [[226]](#post-226).
  - Launch low‑barrier LillyDirect pilots (phone enrollment, multilingual navigation, Medicaid billing, FQHC/340B integration) and commission an independent equity audit with KPIs [[199]](#post-199), [[228]](#post-228), [[272]](#post-272), [[274]](#post-274).

#### **Net Impact**
- Ambiguous. Clear mitigation pathways exist, but current disclosure and access gaps represent tangible operational and reputational risks during the capacity ramp and DTC scale‑up [[121]](#post-121), [[109]](#post-109), [[274]](#post-274).

---

### **Theme 6 — Regulatory and Legal Exposures: Antitrust, Pricing Policy, Diagnostics, and Disclosure Risk**

#### **Scale**
- Antitrust/verticalization: high incretin share plus LillyDirect/manufacturing integration raises credible scrutiny risk; recent adjacent M&A (Verve, SiteOne) shows no near‑term remedies; no agency actions disclosed as of Aug 7, 2025 [[113]](#post-113), [[203]](#post-203), [[158]](#post-158), [[119]](#post-119).
- Pricing‑policy exposure: DTC transparency can fuel parity/negotiation pushes that pressure net price [[99]](#post-99), [[123]](#post-123).
- Diagnostics gate for donanemab: lack of FDA‑cleared plasma p‑tau CDx and national coding/coverage may limit uptake despite assay collaborations [[192]](#post-192), [[221]](#post-221), [[210]](#post-210), [[172]](#post-172).
- Disclosure risk: incomplete methods/governance releases for ATTAIN/SURPASS could invite challenges; window exists to mitigate via proactive publication [[225]](#post-225), [[196]](#post-196), [[191]](#post-191).

#### **Timing**
- Near‑term steady state: no public FTC/DOJ/foreign actions as of Aug 7, 2025; EASD 2025 is the immediate inflection for methodological transparency; pricing‑policy developments are evolving [[158]](#post-158), [[119]](#post-119), [[180]](#post-180), [[123]](#post-123).

#### **Dependencies**
  - Continued absence of antitrust enforcement or structural remedies on incretins/verticalization [[119]](#post-119), [[158]](#post-158).
  - Proactive publication of SAPs, indirect‑comparison diagnostics, DSMB/CEC charters to reduce litigation/regulatory narratives [[196]](#post-196), [[191]](#post-191), [[112]](#post-112), [[294]](#post-294), [[225]](#post-225).
  - Progress toward FDA‑cleared plasma p‑tau CDx and CMS coding/coverage to de‑risk donanemab uptake [[221]](#post-221), [[210]](#post-210).
  - No immediate, formal parity mandates that force DTC–payer price alignment [[123]](#post-123).

#### **Net Impact**
- Neutral‑to‑cautious. Current absence of enforcement and adjacent nature of deals limit near‑term disruption, but policy and disclosure vectors could swing outcomes; transparency and CDx progress are key mitigants [[158]](#post-158), [[203]](#post-203), [[196]](#post-196), [[221]](#post-221).

---

### **Theme 7 — Financial Outlook, Scenarios, and Optionality: Volume-Driven Growth vs Concentration Risk**

#### **Scale**
- Strong P&L momentum: Q2 revenue $15.56B (+38% y/y), non‑GAAP EPS $6.31; perf margin 45.9%; 85% gross margin; FY25 revenue guidance raised to $60–62B; cash returns ongoing (dividend, ~$700M Q2 buybacks) [[34]](#post-34), [[160]](#post-160), [[169]](#post-169), [[23]](#post-23).
- Concentration: incretins ≈55% of Q2 revenue; CVS exclusion already a growth‑rate headwind; guidance uplift not split by volume vs price/mix/M&A [[160]](#post-160), [[114]](#post-114), [[64]](#post-64), [[118]](#post-118), [[151]](#post-151).

#### **Timing**
- 2025‑centric: ≥1.8× ramp in 2H; CVS headwind in Q3; outcomes‑based constructs and APAC optionality are further out [[34]](#post-34), [[110]](#post-110), [[64]](#post-64), [[166]](#post-166).

#### **Dependencies**
  - Deliver ≥1.8× sellable doses; avoid validation/logistics bottlenecks [[110]](#post-110), [[186]](#post-186), [[259]](#post-259).
  - Manage PBM/formulary risk; maintain DTC bridge while employer coverage (~50–55%) improves [[64]](#post-64), [[29]](#post-29), [[52]](#post-52).
  - No adverse policy shock (parity/IRA/MFN) materially compressing net price; management has not published EPS stress‑tests [[123]](#post-123), [[281]](#post-281).
  - Optionality from M&A/platforms (Verve, SiteOne) without delays or remedies [[93]](#post-93), [[183]](#post-183), [[158]](#post-158).

#### **Net Impact**
- Positive but sensitive. The thesis is volume‑driven; concentration, PBM actions, and missing policy stress‑tests keep scenario bands wide. Transparency on supply KPIs and policy sensitivities would reduce uncertainty [[114]](#post-114), [[198]](#post-198), [[281]](#post-281).

---

### **Theme 8 — Global Rollout and APAC Market Access: Pricing, Distribution, and Localization**

#### **Scale**
- Strategic optionality: oral GLP‑1s fit APAC primary‑care and tender models (no cold‑chain/admin burden), enabling tiered pricing and local manufacturing partnerships; lower delivery cost plus CV/metabolic benefits can improve ICERs/budget impact [[103]](#post-103), [[148]](#post-148), [[193]](#post-193), [[222]](#post-222).
- As of Aug 7, 2025, no APAC country‑level launch plans, HTA/tenders, or early Rx metrics for orforglipron are public [[115]](#post-115), [[181]](#post-181), [[234]](#post-234), [[279]](#post-279).

#### **Timing**
- Mid‑term (2025–27): submissions planned by year‑end 2025; APAC inclusion likely follows regulatory/HTA cycles and tendering timelines [[23]](#post-23), [[45]](#post-45), [[279]](#post-279).

#### **Dependencies**
  - Timely regulatory submissions and country‑specific HTA/tender dossiers monetizing SURPASS/ATTAIN signals and oral delivery advantages [[279]](#post-279), [[222]](#post-222).
  - Reliable non‑sterile capacity/logistics and published indicators (non‑sterile vs sterile split/time‑to‑first‑release) to assure supply [[227]](#post-227), [[247]](#post-247).

Cross-Theme Interaction Summary

✅ Orforglipron Market Access and Payer Dynamics: Coverage, Cash Channels, and Value-Based Contracts ↔ Evidence Quality and Clinical Interpretability: ATTAIN-one Estimands, SURPASS-CVOT Indirectness, and Subgroup Transparency — Coverage, tiering, and outcomes contracts depend on SAP‑level transparency and robust indirect‑comparison diagnostics.

✅ Orforglipron Market Access and Payer Dynamics: Coverage, Cash Channels, and Value-Based Contracts ↔ Lilly Direct and Digital Enablement: DTC Channel, Data Asset, and DTx Integration — DTC scale can produce payer‑grade RWE to support evidence‑gated access if pre‑registered plans and interoperable datasets are published.

✅ Orforglipron Market Access and Payer Dynamics: Coverage, Cash Channels, and Value-Based Contracts ↔ Manufacturing Scale-Up and Supply Chain Resilience: Delivering the 1.8x Dose Ramp — Access wins require reliable dose availability; ramp slippage would blunt uptake and weaken contracting leverage.

✅ Evidence Quality and Clinical Interpretability: ATTAIN-one Estimands, SURPASS-CVOT Indirectness, and Subgroup Transparency ↔ Regulatory and Legal Exposures: Antitrust, Pricing Policy, Diagnostics, and Disclosure Risk — Proactive methods/governance disclosures reduce litigation/regulatory risk and strengthen payer negotiations.

✅ Manufacturing Scale-Up and Supply Chain Resilience: Delivering the 1.8x Dose Ramp ↔ ESG and Equity: Environmental Footprint, Access Gaps, and Stigma Dynamics — Environmental disclosures and permit milestones can constrain or enable commissioning and ramp timing.

✅ Lilly Direct and Digital Enablement: DTC Channel, Data Asset, and DTx Integration ↔ ESG and Equity: Environmental Footprint, Access Gaps, and Stigma Dynamics — DTC equity gaps and policy scrutiny can constrain payer reliance unless low‑barrier adaptations and audited KPIs are delivered.

✅ Financial Outlook, Scenarios, and Optionality: Volume-Driven Growth vs Concentration Risk ↔ Manufacturing Scale-Up and Supply Chain Resilience: Delivering the 1.8x Dose Ramp — The volume‑led FY25 thesis is contingent on achieving the ≥1.8× ramp.

✅ Financial Outlook, Scenarios, and Optionality: Volume-Driven Growth vs Concentration Risk ↔ Regulatory and Legal Exposures: Antitrust, Pricing Policy, Diagnostics, and Disclosure Risk — Policy shocks and disclosure gaps can compress net price and widen EPS uncertainty; stress‑tests are absent.

✅ Global Rollout and APAC Market Access: Pricing, Distribution, and Localization ↔ Manufacturing Scale-Up and Supply Chain Resilience: Delivering the 1.8x Dose Ramp — Non‑sterile, cold‑chain‑free capacity and regional readiness underpin APAC tender feasibility.

✅ Global Rollout and APAC Market Access: Pricing, Distribution, and Localization ↔ Evidence Quality and Clinical Interpretability: ATTAIN-one Estimands, SURPASS-CVOT Indirectness, and Subgroup Transparency — HTA value cases in APAC will weigh subgroup effects and methodological rigor to assess ICERs and reimbursement.

### Round 0

<a id="post-1"></a>
[1] **Conference Operator** Conference Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Lilly Q2 twenty twenty five Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. Later, we will be conducting a question and answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mike Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

<a id="post-2"></a>
[2] **Conference Operator** Chris, your line is live.

<a id="post-3"></a>
[3] **Chris Schott, Analyst, JPMorgan** Chris Schott, Analyst, JPMorgan: Great. Thanks so much for the question. Just wanted to kick off with orfrogliptron. There’s obviously a bit of a debate out there this morning on the weight loss profile you’re showing for the product, which clearly looks efficacious, but maybe a touch below Wegovy. Can you just help put the data into context and just in general your thinking of where Orpho fits into the treatment landscape versus Zepbound and Wegovy now that you have these results in hand? Thanks so much.

<a id="post-4"></a>
[4] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Great. Thanks, Chris. We’ll go to Ken to answer the question about the orfaglutron profile.

<a id="post-5"></a>
[5] **Ken Custer, President of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, Eli Lilly** Ken Custer, President of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, Eli Lilly: Yeah, thanks Chris for the question about orfaglutron. We’re really pleased with the data we’ve disclosed this morning. Really the idea that you can get 27 pounds of weight loss from a single pill, and also get really encouraging effects on other important biomarkers, things like blood pressure, lipids, inflammatory biomarkers and fasting glucose. Those are a lot of the things that HCPs are really managing when they think about preventative care. Now you’re getting that all from a single oral pill, but we can manufacture at scale. We also know that simplicity matters in this space and the instructions for use here are going to be pretty simple. Take it once a day without regard to food and water. Of course, the data we’re showing today are in patients with overweight and obesity, but we are evaluating orfaglutidem in a lot of other settings that includes other disease areas like diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea and OA knee pain. We’re also evaluating in other contexts for the treatment of obesity. Right now we have the Attain and Maintain study ongoing, which is also testing orfagliptin as a potential maintenance therapy for patients who have lost weight on drugs like Zepbound to see whether they can keep that weight off. So we really see a wide ranging opportunity for orfaglipron and couldn’t be more pleased with the totality of the profile we disclosed this morning.

<a id="post-6"></a>
[6] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Excellent. Thanks, Chris. Next question, please.

<a id="post-7"></a>
[7] **Conference Operator** Conference Operator: The next question will be from Seamus Fernandez from Guggenheim. Seamus, your line is live.

<a id="post-8"></a>
[8] **Seamus Fernandez, Analyst, Guggenheim** Seamus Fernandez, Analyst, Guggenheim: Oh, great. Thanks so much for the question. Mine’s actually on pricing and the pricing environment going forward. I was just hoping, Dave, you could discuss a little bit more your views on the path for price with orfagliptron and the growing number of assets coming to market. I think that’s been probably the number one overhang, especially as it relates to the continued availability of compounding. So, you know, just trying to get a better understanding of of where you see price going and maybe if you can provide some thoughts on compounding in that context and how you maintain tirzepatide compounding off market when it’s being ignored with semaglutide. Thanks so much.

<a id="post-9"></a>
[9] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Thanks, Seamus. Dave, we’ll go to you talk about the broader pricing environment and potentially weaving in some compounding commentary.

<a id="post-10"></a>
[10] **Dave Ricks, Chair and CEO, Eli Lilly** Dave Ricks, Chair and CEO, Eli Lilly: Okay. Yeah, thanks, Seamus. You know, as it relates to compounding, let me just deal with that first. You know, we’ve always been concerned about this because of the patient safety, risk that exists. Every day we get calls from patients concerned that they are getting ill on a medicine they think is ours and it’s not. This, of course was allowed during drug shortage, there’s no drug shortage. And we really think that regulators and law enforcement officers in The US need to step up their game, to really eliminate this. That’s why we have an FDA and a structured regulatory process in The US. And so we want to see that end mostly because people are being harmed. We see robust growth in the marketplace in The US, 42% total incretin growth over last year, good sequential growth. And of course, Lilly’s growth is more than double that. So the business is fine, but, people shouldn’t be harmed. That said, I think on pricing, we’ve always had a philosophy across all medicines, including with incretins to price to value. And given the profile we present, to consider offsetting other healthcare costs including medicines, the value to the patient, the value in the economy as well. And here with GLP-one and incretin mechanisms we’re seeing profound value, frankly. So, we’re noticing a difference in, when we offer consumer level pricing outside of insurance. But inside of the healthcare system, which is most of the business, we think that we’ll expect single digit erosion like we do other chronic medications in net pricing while maintaining, a value point on lists that makes good sense. That’s not considering any new policy environment, but that’s our philosophy going forward. So as we have a suite of products with some with, perhaps more value in patients with more complicated, obesity, or those that, maybe have less complicated obesity but medicines like oforglipron that could reach the masses, of course we’ll consider those factors in price setting at the list level, and then the net will find its level, in negotiations. And you can continue to expect Lilly to offer consumer level pricing as long as we have such a large hole in coverage, in our country for important chronic disease like obesity that should be covered. Those are our views on pricing.

[11] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Thank you, Dave. Next question, please.

<a id="post-12"></a>
[12] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Eni Lilly and Company’s Q2 twenty twenty five earnings call. I’m Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me on today’s call are Dave Ricks, Lilly’s Chair and CEO Lucas Mondarce, Chief Financial Officer Doctor. Dan Skorowsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology Ann White, President of Lilly Neuroscience Ilya Yufa, President of Lilly USA and Global Customer Capabilities Jake Van Arden, President of Lilly Oncology Patrick Janssen, President of Lilly International and Ken Custer, newly appointed President of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health. We’re also joined by Mark Heumann, Susan Hedgeland and Wyatt Wong of the Investor Relations team. During this call, we anticipate making projections and forward looking statements based on our current expectations. Our actual results may differ materially due to several factors, including those listed on slide four. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially is contained in our latest Form 10 ks and subsequent filings with the SEC. The information we provide about our products and pipeline is for the benefit of the investment community. It is not intended to be promotional and is not sufficient for prescribing decisions. As we transition to our prepared remarks, please note our commentary will focus on our non GAAP financial measures. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Dave.

<a id="post-13"></a>
[13] **Conference Operator** Conference Operator: The next question will be from Geoff Meacham from Citibank. Geoff, your line is live.

<a id="post-14"></a>
[14] **Geoff Meacham, Analyst, Citibank** Geoff Meacham, Analyst, Citibank: Great. Morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Dan, on Orfagliptron, looking at discontinuation rates, looks competitive for ATTAIN and ACHieve. But can you talk about how the GI adverse event rates change over the course of the studies? And were there common futures among those with the highest adverse event rates? Obviously thinking how this could play out from a commercial context. Thank you.

<a id="post-15"></a>
[15] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Thanks, Jeff. Dan, we’ll go to you to talk about some of the ORFO GI profile over time.

<a id="post-16"></a>
[16] **Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly** Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly: Yeah, thanks, Jeff. No surprises in there. The GI profile was as expected for a GLP-one agonist, which

<a id="post-17"></a>
[17] **Lucas Mondrace, Chief Financial Officer, Eli Lilly** Lucas Mondrace, Chief Financial Officer, Eli Lilly: is

<a id="post-18"></a>
[18] **Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly** Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly: to say that most of the side effects occur early in the treatment course or with dose escalations, and then they go down over time. In terms of any specific patient characteristics that predicted, I don’t believe we saw that in the study, nor have we seen that in prior studies with GLP-one. But really, no differences here that we thought were noteworthy versus monotherapy GLP-one injectables. Great.

<a id="post-19"></a>
[19] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Thank you, Dan. Next question, please.

<a id="post-20"></a>
[20] **Conference Operator** Conference Operator: The next question will be from Tim Anderson from Bank of America. Tim, your line is live.

<a id="post-21"></a>
[21] **Tim Anderson, Analyst, Bank of America** Tim Anderson, Analyst, Bank of America: Thank you. I wanted to ask kind of a compounding question in a way, I guess. Canadian generics for Novo’s semaglutide, they’re likely to launch in early ’twenty six. I think everyone can agree that tirzepatide is a better product. Won’t this still cause a lot of trouble in the market there’s a big cash pay channel and where we already know that patients are proving themselves to be price sensitive and willing to use a lesser product like a knockoff semaglutide? Seems to me Canadian generics are just a replacement for that compounding channel, and they’ll keep that headwind alive even if compounders get shut down. And we’re talking about a product here that will have gone through a regulatory review cycle, not by FDA, but by another regulator. So with that launch six months away, is that a headwind that we should expect may continue? Thanks.

<a id="post-22"></a>
[22] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Okay. Thanks, Tim, for the question on the Canadian generics impact. We’ll go to Ilya to answer that one.

<a id="post-23"></a>
[23] **Dave Ricks, Chair and CEO, Eli Lilly** Dave Ricks, Chair and CEO, Eli Lilly: Thanks, Mike. Q2 was a strong quarter. We delivered robust revenue growth, shared top line clinical data from multiple Phase III programs and invested in several initiatives that will support our future growth. Today, we shared positive top line data from the ATTAIN-one or Forgopron trial in people with obesity. In ATTAIN-one, patients taking the highest dose of Orforgopron lost more than 27 pounds, or 12.4% of their body weight. In addition, the safety and tolerability in ATAIN-one was consistent with the injectable GLP-one class. Orforglipron also met all secondary endpoints in this study, improving key markers of metabolic health, such as blood pressure, cholesterol, and inflammation. This is the second positive phase three trial for orforglipron we reported this year, and we’re encouraged by these results. Our goal from the beginning was to create a medicine that has a clinical profile consistent with approved GLP-one, while offering the convenience of a once daily pill and the production flexibility of small molecule chemistry to meet global demand. We believe this medicine has the potential to make a significant impact on human health, and we will now work with urgency to submit oforgopron around the world to meet the global challenge of obesity. On slide six, we list key Q2 financial metrics and highlight progress related to our strategic deliverables. Revenue grew 38% compared to Q2 twenty twenty four, driven by our key products. These include Evglis, Jaypirca, Kisunla, Mounjaro, Omvoh, Verzenio and Zepbound. In The U. S, we continue the robust uptake of Zepbound and Mounjaro, and Lilly gained market share in the incretin analog class for the fourth quarter in a row. Mounjaro also recently became the market leader in The U. S. In total prescriptions within the type two diabetes incretin market. Outside The U. S, we continue to launch Mounjaro in new countries. These include Mexico and Brazil most recently. We have now launched Mounjaro in most major markets. Q2 was also a quarter of continued investment for Lilly. In addition to increasing commercial activities to support our newest medicines, we started multiple new clinical programs. While the company is experiencing rapid revenue growth, we’re also increasing our R and D investment, as early phase program data continues to impress us, and to support our future growth of the company. Our financial performance in the 2025 was strong. And as a result, we raised our revenue and earnings per share guidance. Lucas will cover this in more detail during the financial update. In addition to the results from ATTAIN-one, we achieved several key milestones since our last earnings call. These include the U. S. FDA approval of a new dosing schedule for Kisumla, positive European CHMP opinion for Kisunla. Announced positive results in the SURPASS CVOT Phase three trial for tirzepatide in people with type two diabetes and heart disease. We announced positive results in the BREWIN CLL-three 14 Phase three trial of pirtobrutinib in CLL and SLL. And we launched the two highest doses of Zepbound in vials in The United States. We announced and closed the acquisition of SiteOne Therapeutics, which expands Lilly’s pain portfolio and adds a clinical stage non opioid pain program to our mix. And Verve Therapeutics, which adds new genetic medicines for cardiovascular disease with potential to only be administered once in a person’s lifetime. We made progress in Q2 and throughout the 2025 to bring new manufacturing capacity online. We produced more than 1.6 times the amount of saleable incretive doses during the 2025 when compared to the 2024. This includes a significant step up in capacity from our recently constructed facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. We will continue to bring more capacity online in the 2025 and expect our production capabilities to increase further. We also plan to announce the location of two of our new U. S. Manufacturing facilities later this quarter. During the quarter, we distributed $1,300,000,000 in dividends and executed approximately $700,000,000 in share repurchases. Before I turn the call over to Lucas, I’d like to offer some perspective on the drug pricing reform discussion that’s going on. While we support the administration’s position that medical research costs need to be shared more equitably across developed countries, it’s also true that The US pharmaceutical market has significant defects, which shift costs to consumers and increase red tape. These problems also require urgent reform and make apples to apples comparisons of ex factory pricing inaccurate and misleading. At Lilly, we’ve already implemented several initiatives which directly lower patient costs for our most commonly used medicines. We operate a direct to consumer model at scale through Lilly Direct, which provides more affordable access to Lilly medicines. This includes our leading weight loss medications that found at a discount of more than 50% off the list price. We also led in resolving insulin pricing issues in our country by reducing list prices by 70% and ensuring broad access to $35 monthly patient costs, including for Medicare. Negotiated prices in Europe come with broad access, low patient co pays, and without administrative hurdles like prior authorizations. There are also no intermediaries that distort prices, and hospitals do not seek profit by selling medicines and marking them up. If we import foreign price controls and insert them into a U. S. System that isn’t built to function for patients, we risk embracing the worst of two worlds, the low productivity and output of Europe’s biopharma sector, with the high out of pocket and distorted prices of The US insurance market. Both today’s patients and the future of new cures and treatments will suffer, along with The United States’ competitiveness. Of course, we will engage and are committed to working constructively with the administration to find solutions that both benefit patients while preserving the hope for tomorrow’s cures and the scientific base that has made America the envy of all in global pharmaceutical innovation. Now I’ll turn the call over to Lucas to review our Q2 results.

<a id="post-24"></a>
[24] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly0** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly0: Yeah. Thanks for the question. Maybe I’ll touch on what we’re currently seeing in The US market. And if you assume looking at the self pay market that what we’re seeing in vial performance and overall market is continuing to grow at rapid pace. We’re seeing that our offering with the vial with setbound and the profile that we have with setbound is meeting a need for patients, even in the context of noise, whether you have compounded or semi in market. You take a look at just the growth that we’ve seen in Q2, we’ve generated over 1,000,000 TRX in vial in Q2. And we recently launched last week, the highest doses of vial available for Zepbound. And we’re continuing to see health in that market. Roughly 20% of all of our TRx is coming from the cash pay market and continue to see strength overall, both in self pay and covered. We’re seeing around 65% share market in new therapy starts for ZBound overall. So we see health in the market and where ZBound provides a greater value.

<a id="post-25"></a>
[25] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Great. Thanks, Ilya. We’ll go to the next question, please.

<a id="post-26"></a>
[26] **Conference Operator** Conference Operator: The next question will be from Dave Risinger from Leerink Partners. Dave, your line is live.

<a id="post-27"></a>
[27] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly1** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly1: Yes, thanks very much. So I was hoping to better understand the evolution of US employer coverage for anti obesity medicines and the prospects. So my understanding is that coverage has been pretty flat on a net basis over the last eighteen months, let’s say since January ’4, meaning the net covered lives has been flattish. If you can confirm that that’s correct. And then can you talk about the outlook for the net change in U. S. Employer coverage for anti obesity medicines over the next six months or so for January ’6? Thanks very much.

<a id="post-28"></a>
[28] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Great. Thanks, Dave, the question. We’ll go to Ilya to talk about the progress in the debt bound employer coverage, Optin.

<a id="post-29"></a>
[29] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly0** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly0: Sure. Thanks for the question, Dave. You know, as we take a look at employer coverage, it’s important for us to grow coverage over time. What we’ve seen in different offerings across the different plans, some are more complex than others, and we’ve seen an increase overall but it has been steady around 50% to 55% employer opt in coverage. At the same time, we are seeing new benefit designs like for instance, EverNorth’s a cap on out of pocket for employees that make the prior authorization or simplified and that may grow employer opt ins over time. That’s something that we’re working through. Our outlook is that as evidence grows and we find new ways and also different plan designs are available to different employers that that will continue to do.

<a id="post-30"></a>
[30] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Great. Thank you, Ilya. We’ll go to next question, please.

<a id="post-31"></a>
[31] **Conference Operator** Conference Operator: The next question will be from Terence Flynn from Morgan Stanley. Terence, line is live.

<a id="post-32"></a>
[32] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Congrats on all the progress. Just wondering on orfagliptron in light of the ATTAIN-one data, if you can just frame expectations for us, Dan, for the upcoming ATTAIN-two Phase III data? And then any early insights into the potential CMMI obesity Medicare Medicaid pilot that I think we saw some press reports about? Thank you. Okay. For that we’ll go to Ken to answer the question on expectations for ATTAIN-two.

<a id="post-33"></a>
[33] **Ken Custer, President of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, Eli Lilly** Ken Custer, President of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, Eli Lilly: Yeah, thanks, Terrence, for the question on ATTAIN-two. You know, we’re very pleased with what we disclosed this morning in ATTAIN-one, which is our first phase three study in obesity without diabetes. And of course, we had a great result with Achieve one in patients with diabetes. So as we look ahead to ATTAIN-two, we expect similarly encouraging results. The exciting thing about ATTAIN-two is that be our third phase III study and it sets us up to submit in obesity by the end of this year. So really no change in expectations here. The team is full speed ahead preparing for submission by year end and a potential approval next year. Great.

<a id="post-34"></a>
[34] **Lucas Mondrace, Chief Financial Officer, Eli Lilly** Lucas Mondrace, Chief Financial Officer, Eli Lilly: Thanks, Dave. As shown on slide seven, Q2 was another strong quarter of financial performance. Revenue grew 38% compared to Q2 twenty twenty four, driven by our key products. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 85% in Q2, an increase of three percentage points versus the same quarter last year. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by improved cost of production and favorable product mix, which were partially offset by lower realized prices. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased by 30% as we continue to increase investment to support our newest launches across therapeutic areas and geographies. R and D expenses increased 23%, driven by higher expenses for late stage assets and additional investment in early stage research. Our non GAAP performance margin, which we define as gross margin less R and D, marketing, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was 45.9%. Performance margin increased by more than six percentage points from Q2 twenty twenty four, driven by revenue growth. Our Q2 effective tax rate was 16.5%, consistent with Q2 twenty twenty four. At the bottom line, earnings per share increased 61% to $6.31 including of a negative impact of $0.14 from acquired IPR and D charges. This compares to March in Q2 twenty twenty four, which also include $0.14 of acquired IPR and D charges. On Slide eight, we quantify the effect of price, rate and volume on revenue growth. U. S. Revenue increased 38% in Q2, driven by strong volume growth of Zepan and Mojaro, partially offset by an 8% decline in price. In Europe, revenue grew 77% in constant currency, reflecting the strong uptake of Mounjaro. Japan revenue grew 7% in constant currency, driven by Mounjaro and Eplis. In China, revenue increased 19% in constant currency driven by volume growth of Mounjaro. Revenue in the rest of the world decreased by 1% in constant currency driven primarily by stocking in the base period related to Mounjaro launches in new markets. This impact was largely offset by volume growth of Mounjaro and Verzenio this year. Slide nine provides an update of the performance of our key products. Beginning with immunology, Eplis continues to perform well in atopic dermatitis. New patient starts and revenue trends are strong and total prescriptions have nearly doubled since Q1. We also made progress securing access and Evolus is now covered by all three of the largest pharmacy benefit managers that represent 90% of people with commercial insurance. For Ombo, we are one full quarter into the launch in Crohn’s disease and are making progress in a competitive market. The new citrate free formulation is available in most major markets and we are seeing positive trends in new patient starts in The U. S, Germany, Japan and other international markets. Moving to oncology, physician feedback on JYPRICA continued to be very positive. While still only approving later lines of CLL and MCL, we have seen a strong uptake within the label population and encouraging trends regarding time on therapy. We continue to generate additional data in Phase III trials that we believe will support an expanded label and use in early settings. We recently announced positive results of BERUIN three point four in CLL and SCLL is another positive step forward those goals. Verzenio global sales grew 12% in Q2, driven by volume growth. Verzenio continued to be the NBRx and TRx market leader in The U. S. And standard of care in high risk early breast cancer. U. S. Prescriptions grew by 4% in Q2 compared to Q2 twenty twenty four, and international volume grew by 18%. Within neuroscience, Kisanda is continuing a steady launch trajectory, and we are making significant progress in driving healthcare system readiness and adoption. In The U. S, we are seeing a strong diagnostic growth driven by PET and the acceleration of blood biomarker tests. This momentum is leading to more people being diagnosed and accessing treatment. Over 1,500 physicians and 150 of the top healthcare organizations have started patients on Keysondra. Outside The U. S, efforts are progressing as well, with approval in 13 countries. In Europe, we anticipate approval and launch later this year, following the recent CHMP positive opinion. Finally, moving to cardiometabolic health, Moncharo and Zepan both delivered impressive performance. Moncharo posted $5,200,000,000 of global sales and exited the quarter with more than fifty percent of new type two diabetes increasing prescriptions in The U. S. Mounjaro also became The U. S. Market leader in total type two diabetes in creatine prescriptions in July and has gained eight percentage points in total prescription share of market during the first seven months of 2025. With the recently announced positive results from SURPARS CVOT, we look forward to submitting this data to global regulators to support a labeled cardiovascular indication. Outside The U. S, tirzepedau is now launched in most major markets. As a reminder, Mounjaro is marketed as a single brand for both chronic weight management and type two diabetes in all international markets except Canada and Japan. While the initial reception of recent launches in Mexico, Brazil, China and India has been excellent, the commercial activities have been measured to ensure demand doesn’t exceed supply and that patients and physicians have a good experience. SEPAN performance was strong in Q2, contributing $3,400,000,000 of sales. SEPAN continues to be The U. S. Market leader in the branded anti obesity market, with two thirds of total patients taking SEPAN. We recently launched the twelve point five and fifteen milligram single use vials in Libidirect. All doses of Zeppelin are not available in the vial presentation. While we work to secure broader reimbursement of anti obesity medicines, we are encouraged by the uptake of Zeppelin in vials. The cash pay vials were approximately 20% of total U. S. Zeppelin prescriptions and over 35% of new prescriptions in Q2. As a reminder, effective July 1, the CVS Pharmacy Benefit Manager began excluding SEPAN as an offering for patients on its template formulary insurance plans. This has caused significant disruption to patients, and we strongly disagree with the decision to restrict access to medicines for patients. As demonstrated in randomized clinical trials, incretin medicines for chronic weight management are not all the same. While it’s still early, we have seen this decision negatively impact Zepbound prescriptions during July and expect it to be a headwind to the rate of volume growth in Q3. We remain confident in the long term growth outlook for SEBON as the most widely used incretin therapy in the branded anti obesity market. On Slide 10, we provide a view on The U. S. Incretin analog market, which include prescription for both type two diabetes and chronic weight management. Q2 was another quarter of steady market growth as total prescription grew by 41% compared to Q2 twenty twenty four. Lilly performance was again strong with share of market reaching above 57%, an increase of 3.8 percentage points compared to Q1 twenty twenty five. While market growth continued to be robust, overall penetration into the addressable population is still low and we believe significantly more patients can benefit from incretin therapy. On slide 11, we provide an update on capital allocation. Moving to slide 12 is our updated expectation for our 2025 financial performance. We are encouraged by the underlying performance we saw across the business in the first half of the year. We are increasing the bottom and the top end of the revenue range, as well as our expectation for performance margins and earnings per share. We now anticipate our revenue will be between 60,000,000,000 and $62,000,000,000 This range reflects the strong performance and a tailwind from foreign exchange rates. We will continue to invest to support our newest launches and to develop new medicines. Given our updated expectations for revenue growth, we now expect non GAAP performance margin to be between 4345.5% as a percentage of revenue. The potential effect of tariffs remains dynamic, and we will continue to update our estimate as the situation changes. We expect the 2025 impact of currently announced tariffs to be modest, and this has been factored into our 2025 guidance range. At the bottom line, we have increased our outlook for non GAAP earnings per share and expect EPS of $21.75 to $23 As Dave mentioned earlier, we exceeded our increasing sellable doses production in the first half of the year and expect to bring more capacity online during the 2025. We expect to produce at least 1.8 times the number of sellable incretin doses in the 2025 compared to the 2024. Now I will turn the call over to Dan to highlight our progress on R and D.

[36] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: you want to hop back in the queue, Terrence, we’ll see if there’s time for your second one. Next question, please.

<a id="post-37"></a>
[37] **Conference Operator** Conference Operator: The next question will be from Courtney Breen from Bernstein. Courtney, your line is live.

<a id="post-38"></a>
[38] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly2** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly2: Hello, thanks so much for taking the question today. Just coming back to another question on ortho, as we looked at kind of comparing the data between ATTAIN-one and Achieve-one, we do see that kind of nausea, vomiting, constipation all appear a bit higher in this Achieve one study. Can you talk a little bit about the differences in those data points that we’re seeing between those two studies and what that might mean for adherence in the real world? Thank you.

<a id="post-39"></a>
[39] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Courtney, thanks for the question on comparing achieve versus attain. I think, Dan, maybe a couple of quick comments.

<a id="post-40"></a>
[40] **Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly** Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly: Yeah, sure. Thanks, Courtney. I think the side effect profile in both of these trials was consistent with past experience for GLP-one monotherapy in these populations, which are different, as you’re pointing out, that side effect profiles can be different in people with type two diabetes versus people without type two diabetes and with obesity. So I think we feel quite confident overall about the profile here. Of course, I think I’d just emphasize once again that this is a GLP-one monotherapy. We know that dual agonism with GLP-one and GIP-one can offer superior results. We have that as an injectable as tirzepatide. But I think actually this is as good as it gets for GLP-one monotherapy here in a once a day small molecule oral. So we’re pretty excited with the profile.

<a id="post-41"></a>
[41] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Great. Thanks, Dan. Next question, please.

<a id="post-42"></a>

<a id="post-43"></a>
[43] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly3** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly3: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. Dan, if you could comment on the gender split in the ofligipron study, if there was any difference versus any other trials for GLP-one that you would want to highlight here?

<a id="post-44"></a>
[44] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly4** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly4: Thank you. Sure.

<a id="post-45"></a>
[45] **Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly** Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly: Thanks, Lucas. We’ve made quite a bit of progress since our last earnings call. During just the past two weeks, we shared three Phase III readouts from some of our most important molecules. I’ll start with these. Last week, we announced results from the tirzepatide SURPASS CVOT trial, where tirzepatide demonstrated cardiovascular protection in a landmark head to head trial, which was the first ever cardiovascular outcomes trial comparing two incretin therapies in people with type two diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It included over 13,000 participants across 30 countries, and it is the largest and longest study of tirzepatide to date. As shown on slide 13, tirzepatide achieved the primary objective of the study, demonstrating noninferiority compared to Trulicity with an eight percent lower rate of MACE-three events. Tirzepatide showed consistent results across all three components of the MACE-three composite endpoint. We were particularly impressed to see the rate of all cause mortality was sixteen percent lower on tirzepatide versus dulaglutide. Because this trial did not include a placebo arm, we conducted a pre specified indirect comparison analysis of matched patient level data from the REWIND and SURPASS CBOT studies. This analysis showed that tirzepatide reduced the risk of MACE three by twenty eight percent and reduced all cause mortality by thirty nine percent compared to putative placebo. We’re very pleased with these results, which show that in addition to the well established best in class weight loss and A1C control, tirzepatide now also provides a cardioprotective benefit and may provide more wide reaching health improvements, including greater kidney protection and a reduced overall risk of death. We look forward to detailed results being presented at the EASD meeting in September and published in a peer reviewed journal. We plan to submit these data to global regulators by the end of this year. The SURPASS CVOT results reinforce our enthusiasm for Surmount MMO, which enrolled over fifteen thousand participants with obesity, and will assess the impact of tirzepatide on reducing morbidity and mortality. This is an event based study, and the rate of accrual will dictate the timing of the readout. While SURPASS CBOT and SURMUNT MMO are likely the largest randomized trials we’ll conduct with tirzepatide, we’ll still explore additional indications for this molecule. And we’re excited to have started a new phase three trial in people with type one diabetes. Moving on to orforglipron. As Dave mentioned, today we’re excited to announce top line results from our second orforglipron phase three trial, ATTAIN-one. This trial included people with obesity but without type two diabetes. As shown on slide 14, patients in a TAIN one lost on average between 7.812.4% of their body weight after seventy two weeks, depending on the dose. At the highest dose, the average participant on orforglipron lost more than 27 pounds. And approximately forty percent of people on this dose lost more than 15% of their body weight. We also saw notable improvements on important drivers of cardiovascular risk, including non HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood pressure. Moving to slide 15, we are very pleased with the safety profile of orforglipron in ATTAIN-one. The most commonly reported adverse events were gastrointestinal, which is consistent with the GLP-one class. Discontinuations due to adverse events were low, with five percent to ten percent of patients discontinuing orforglipron across doses. Doses. There were no hepatic safety signals. We look forward to sharing detailed results from ATTAIN-one also at the EASD meeting in September and in a peer reviewed publication. With today’s readout, we’ve now seen results from two large phase three clinical trials involving over 3,600 participants, and we’re highly encouraged with what we’ve seen thus far. The data from these first two pivotal studies provide evidence that a once daily oral GLP-one can achieve efficacy and safety in line with injectable GLP-1s. Orforglipron has the potential to be a more convenient alternative to injectable treatments and to be utilized to support early disease intervention in the primary care setting. With these data in hand, we’re now working to move quickly towards our first regulatory submissions yet this year. We expect results from four additional orforglipron Phase III trials over the next five months, three trials in people with diabetes from our Achieve program, and one additional trial from the ATTAIN program in people with diabetes and obesity. ATTAIN one and ATTAIN two will support global submissions for chronic weight management, which we expect in Q4. In addition to the ongoing phase three trials for orforglipron in diabetes, obesity, weight maintenance, and obstructive sleep apnea, we initiated a new program for orforglipron this quarter, Attain Hypertension, focused on reducing systolic blood pressure at thirty six weeks as the primary endpoint. This is the first study of orforglipron that includes patients with a baseline BMI as low as twenty five. We also announced plans to initiate a new phase three trial in people with knee osteoarthritis pain and overweight or obesity starting later this year. Moving to pirtobrutinib. We announced positive results from the Bruin CLL-three 14 phase three trial of pirtobrutinib compared to ibrutinib in people with CLL, SLL. This trial included treatment naive patients as well as patients previously treated but not with a BTK inhibitor. Pirtobrutinib met the primary endpoint of response rate non inferiority compared to ibrutinib and had a nominal p value for superiority that was less than 0.05. While progression free survival data were immature, there was a positive trend in favor of pirtobrutinib. Additional testing for progression free survival is planned as part of a future analysis. Of note, the subpopulation of treatment naive patients had a particularly pronounced progression free survival trend in favor of pirtobrutinib. This subpopulation had the longest follow-up, which is encouraging for what we might see more broadly across the total study population over time. This is second positive phase three trial to read out for pirtobrutinib as we continue to build evidence supporting the potential role for this medicine in earlier settings. We look forward to the readout of Bruin CLL-three 13, which assesses pirtobrutinib versus chemo immunotherapy in treatment naive CLL, SLL later this year. We expect these data in combination with Bruin CLL-three 14 to form the basis of regulatory submissions globally. In addition to our recent Phase III readouts, we also have updates on several other important molecules, danenemab, retreutide, and ola moracib. For danenemab, we had three important milestones since our last earnings call. First, we were pleased to receive a positive opinion from the CHMP in The EU. We look forward to approval and launch there later this year. Second, the modified dosing schedule was approved in The US, further strengthening the safety profile for danenemab, and we expect the modified dosing regimen to be part of the EU labeling at launch as well. Finally, we shared long term extension data from TRAILblazer ALS two, which demonstrated that over three years, danetumab treated participants showed increasing clinical benefit, despite most participants having completed treatment within the first eighteen months of the trial. In a separate part of the extension study, patients initiating dananemab after eighteen months of placebo also demonstrated disease slowing once they started dananemab. These data reinforce the value of early intervention and support the limited duration dosing approach with sustained and increasing long term benefits for treatment. For retreotide, we started a new phase three trial in chronic low back pain and overweight or obesity called TRIUMF seven. This is our second pain study for retreotide in addition to the ongoing study in osteoarthritis pain of the knee, TRIUMF four, from which we expect results later this year. We are excited to announce plans to initiate a Phase III study in high risk metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease, or MACEL D, later this year. This trial includes both retreotide and tirzepatide, and it will utilize noninvasive tests to enroll patients who are at high risk of major adverse liver outcomes, with a primary objective of reducing the occurrence of such outcomes. This novel trial design more closely mirrors how physicians diagnose this disease in clinical practice and will enable simultaneous development of both medicines, each compared to placebo. In a prior phase II trial in MACEL D, retreutide reduced liver fat by over 80%. And in a phase II trial in NASH, tirzepatide led to over half of patients meeting criteria for resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis. We believe each of these medicines has the potential to make a profound impact on this disease, and we look forward to initiating the study later this year. Moving to ola moracet, we started a Phase III trial in unresected adjuvant lung cancer. This marks the fourth indication we are simultaneously pursuing for olimarasib in KRAS G12C mutant lung cancer as part of the SUNRAY I and SUNRAY II programs. We believe olimarasib, in combination with immuno oncology agents in an early setting, could improve the standard of care for patients with KRAS G12C mutant lung cancer. I’m also excited that through business development, we’ve added new molecules to our portfolio and new colleagues to our team. And it’s a pleasure to welcome new team members from SiteOne and Verve to Lilly this quarter. With SiteOne, we added a new pain asset into our neuroscience portfolio, STC004, is a Nav1.8 inhibitor that’s shown encouraging early data to treat pain. We believe this molecule could be an important non opioid therapy for pain in the future. Through the acquisition of Verve Therapeutics, we added several genetic medicines for cardiovascular disease that may only need to be given once in a lifetime. The most advanced programs are VIRV-one 102, which targets PCSK9, and VIRV-two zero one, which targets ANGPTL3. And in our early phase portfolio, we advanced nisotirastide, our PYY analog agonist, into a Phase II trial in people with diabetes. And we initiated Phase I clinical trials for glucose sensing insulin, a PTK7 antibody drug conjugate in oncology, and a next generation triple agonist in cardiometabolic health. We also discontinued two phase II programs, KB1.3 antagonist for psoriasis and mazisotine for pain. And two phase I programs at Econic mimetic immunology and SCAPT siRNA in mesh. It was a productive period since our last earnings call, and we still have an ambitious R and D agenda for the last five months of 2025. I’ll now turn the call back to Dave for some closing remarks.

<a id="post-46"></a>
[46] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Mohit, for the detailed question. We’ll go to Ken to talk about the gender split. Is there anything to flag?

<a id="post-47"></a>
[47] **Ken Custer, President of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, Eli Lilly** Ken Custer, President of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, Eli Lilly: Yeah, thanks, Mohit. Gender split baseline population at TAME one was about 64% across the board, well balanced across 64% female across all arms, balanced nothing really to remark on here.

<a id="post-48"></a>
[48] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Great. Thanks. Thanks, Ken. Next question, please.

<a id="post-49"></a>
[49] **Conference Operator** Conference Operator: The next question will be from Asad Haider from Goldman Sachs. Asad, your line is live.

<a id="post-50"></a>
[50] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly5** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly5: Great. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. Just going back to channel dynamics. On the Lilly direct channel, clearly, Zepbound growth has been getting a lot of momentum with the new to brand prescriptions. Where do you think this could stabilize? And how is that segment changing the landscape on pricing? And then related, I think, Lucas, you previously framed this DTC offering for Zepbound as a hedge or a bridge solution as you continue to grow access in the reimbursed channel. So any evolution in your thinking on that front, given DTC offerings are now getting framed as one way to satisfy the administration’s demands on drug pricing? Thank you.

<a id="post-51"></a>
[51] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Okay. Thanks for the question, Assad. Lucas, you want give some commentary on the Blue Direct revolution and outlook from here?

<a id="post-52"></a>
[52] **Lucas Mondrace, Chief Financial Officer, Eli Lilly** Lucas Mondrace, Chief Financial Officer, Eli Lilly: Yes, sure. Thank you, Assad, for your question. First of all, I just wanted to highlight the great products that we see in Lilly Direct. I think Eli alluded about the total TRS prescription that we see in the second quarter, one point one million TRx, fantastic growth, and now we are adding the twelve point five and fifteen milligrams launch as well. So, great progress that we are seeing, you see that data as well that you have access aside in terms of the number of total DRx as a percentage of the total SEP BAN business. So, progressing very nicely, very pleased with that. You mentioned about, again, the hedge, yes, I shared that with you a time ago, and that’s the way that we think about it, going back to the previous questions about employer, as we see that progressing, we always thought that it would be a gradual progression on the employer access. We see the Leading Direct as an option to bridge that, right, as a hedge strategy to bridge that. So, we still see it the same way, but it’s progressing very nicely and it’s growing very is actually contributing to our performance this quarter and for the rest of the year as well. So that’s more of the commentary and the color that we can provide today on that.

<a id="post-53"></a>
[53] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Thank you, Lucas. Next question, please.

<a id="post-54"></a>
[54] **Conference Operator** Conference Operator: The next question will be from Umer Raffat from Evercore. Umer, your line is live.

<a id="post-55"></a>
[55] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly3** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly3: Morning, guys. I’m just still trying to get my head around the ofligipron data. On the one side, I see your efficacy estimate at eleven point five percent placebo adjusted being very consistent with what Novo showed with their oral SEMA data in OASIS IV. But on the more important ITT like treatment estimate, Orfo’s tracking at nine percent placebo adjusted. Oral SEMA is almost fourteen percent placebo adjusted.

<a id="post-56"></a>
[56] **Dave Ricks, Chair and CEO, Eli Lilly** Dave Ricks, Chair and CEO, Eli Lilly: Thanks, Dan. We’re really pleased with all the progress in Q2 across our strategic agenda. We’ve had another quarter of strong financial results. We continued the build out of our manufacturing footprint and advanced our pipeline, as Dan just highlighted, with external and internal R and D projects. We have good momentum as we enter the 2025, and we’re focused on execution with our currently marketed products, and we’re investing in the next wave of medicines that we expect will drive growth in the near and more distant future.

<a id="post-57"></a>
[57] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** And I’m just trying to understand what explains that delta, and does it prompt the need for a forty five milligram cohort, considering how the safety is tracking?

<a id="post-58"></a>
[58] **Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly** Dan Skovronsky, Chief Scientific Officer and President of Lilly Immunology, Eli Lilly: Yeah. Thanks, Umer. I’m not sure I tracked exactly with your numbers. But look, I think overall, the profile here landed pretty much where you could expect GLP-one monotherapy to land. It’s tough to compare different trials done at different time periods in different populations. But I think overall, given the patients we enrolled and the trial we ran, this is what GLP-one agonism can give you. I don’t see this as any issue at all in the real world or for patients or doctors. I know Wall Street has kind of focused on the exact numbers here and making cross trial comparisons, but I don’t think that carries over to the real world at all. Great.

<a id="post-59"></a>
[59] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Thank you, Dan. Next question, please.

<a id="post-60"></a>
[60] **Conference Operator** Conference Operator: Next question will be from Steve Scala from TD Cowen. Steve, your

<a id="post-61"></a>
[61] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly3** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly3: line Oh, thank you. Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly4: Thank you so much. With what is widely viewed as disappointing orfagliptron data, it seems injectables are where it’s at for the foreseeable future. On the Q1 call, Lilly said the likely impact of the Novo deal with CVS would be modest. But today, you are saying there could be an impact in Q3. And for Lilly to call it out in the prepared remarks, it must be pretty meaningful.

<a id="post-62"></a>
[62] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly4** So, can you tell us what changed in the marketplace for the injectables? Thank you.

<a id="post-63"></a>
[63] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Great, Steve. Thanks for the question. Maybe to give some commentary on CVS, we’ll go to Ilya.

<a id="post-64"></a>
[64] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly0** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly0: Sure. Thanks, Steve, for the question. You know, as we take a look at Q2 performance and the health of both the market and where Zepfone has gained share, and we added around 1,700,000 TRx in Q2. The overall impact, I think what we discussed prior is a couple 100,000 TRx volume that may vary. It’s still early in the transition to CVS and obviously that creates frustration for employers, for providers, for patients. And we don’t agree and disappointed with CVS decision. At the same time, in terms of impact, you’ll have some medical exceptions and overall in the context of growing 1,700,000 TRx, we view and you look at July TRx as a proxy where it’s on average, it’s back to around May average TRx. We see continued growth and very good performance across all segments for Zepbound both in covered as well as our cash pay market. And so we expect continued growth. I think the commentary is more about the rate of growth. So obviously, some new patient starts related to CVS template only may have some impact on growth, but overall the growth is healthy across all other segments.

<a id="post-65"></a>
[65] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Great. Thank you, Ilya. Next question, please.

<a id="post-66"></a>
[66] **Conference Operator** Conference Operator: The next question will be from Alex Hammond from Wolfe Research. Alex, your line is live.

<a id="post-67"></a>
[67] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** So now let me turn the call over to Mike to moderate a Q and A session.

<a id="post-68"></a>
[68] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly6** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly6: Another one on orfaglipirone. So I noticed you included the total discontinuation rates in the PR when you normally don’t. Does that suggest that you think there was an underlying driver of these unusually elevated dropout rates across all arms? And could they have impacted efficacy?

<a id="post-69"></a>
[69] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Thanks, Alex. We’ll go to Ken to talk about the inclusion of the overall discontinuation rates and how that may have been

<a id="post-70"></a>
[70] **Ken Custer, President of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, Eli Lilly** Ken Custer, President of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, Eli Lilly: in some other press releases as well. Yeah, thanks, Alex, for the question on discontinuation rates. What we disclosed, of course, with the rate of discontinuation at ATTAIN-one for placebo of 29.9% and then for orfaglifron ranging from twenty two to twenty four percent. We don’t think there’s anything remarkable there. And we’ve disclosed these information on previous Lilly programs. I think on Surmount one we did. Maybe to put this in a little bit of context, if you look at analogous studies in obesity, really placebo rates are in the 20s. If you take maybe step one, twenty two percent placebo rate for discontinuation and about five points lower for active comparator. That’s exactly what we see here on a delta. So really nothing remarkable here. The more important thing to look at, know, course patients can discontinue a study for a whole host of reasons. They can just withdraw their consent because it doesn’t fit with their life. They’re not getting the efficacy they need and that’s why we typically see lower rates in the active drugs, which is what we see here, or an adverse event. Now the rates for adverse events, as Dan noted, range between five and ten percent for glucapon, that’s exactly where we’d expect to be for an oral GLP-one single agonist. So really nothing remarkable here.

<a id="post-71"></a>
[71] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Great. Thank you, Ken. We’ll go to the next question please.

<a id="post-72"></a>
[72] **Conference Operator** Conference Operator: The next question will be from Akash Tewari from Jefferies. Akash, your line is live.

<a id="post-73"></a>
[73] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly7** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly7: Hey, thanks so much. What’s Lilly’s appetite to committing to launching new products at net parity pricing between The US and Europe given a significant amount of your newly launched products in Europe are actually not getting reimbursed anyway? And more broadly, it sounds like we’re in an impasse between the administration and the industry. What’s your confidence we’d be able to get kind of a bespoke solution with the administration absent new legislation? Thank you.

<a id="post-74"></a>
[74] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Great. Thank you, Akash. We’ll go to Dave to talk on the engagement with the administration and new product launch strategy.

<a id="post-75"></a>
[75] **Dave Ricks, Chair and CEO, Eli Lilly** Dave Ricks, Chair and CEO, Eli Lilly: Sure. Yeah. I mean, just on the discrete question you’re asking, I think we believe long term, we should rebalance pricing between US and Europe in terms of who’s bearing the cost for really the amortized R and D and the risk we took. That’s a rational thing. And it’s, in my career, gotten more and more out of whack. So I think here the president’s right to call that out. The question is really how? And as you know, the European governments don’t exactly, they’re not signing up to pay more for drugs. So we need trade tools to rebalance that equation. We’ve been very clear on that advocacy with both European and US governments. And in The US, we need to deflate the gross to net bubble, because there’s this huge artificial thing that needs to get deflated. The problem with doing that suddenly is all those cash flows into hospitals and premium support for seniors and Part D, etcetera. You can’t collapse it all at once, it’d be very difficult, I think. So the idea of new products gives it sort of a ramp. But we need these other structural changes on The US side and the gross to net environment in Europe in terms of the total reimbursement setup to get there. But we’d be excited to enter that world. And actually, I’ll point out in a few cases, we are narrowing the gap substantially on new products. And, some of that’s for the reason you point out that, some countries that reimbursement is just a tough equation. So what’s the point of lowering that? So watch that space. I think this is an area there could be progress under the President’s agenda. I think you’d see most, pharma companies interested in moving in that direction. The question is how do you step into it?

<a id="post-76"></a>
[76] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Great, thank you, Dave. We’ve got time for probably two more quick questions. The next question, please.

<a id="post-77"></a>
[77] **Conference Operator** Conference Operator: The next question will be from Kerry Hallford from Berenberg. Kerry, your line is live.

<a id="post-78"></a>
[78] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Thanks, Dave. We would like to take questions from as many callers as possible. So consistent with prior quarters, we will respond to one question per caller, and we’ll end the call promptly at 09:30. Please provide the instructions for the Q and A session and then we are ready for the first caller.

<a id="post-79"></a>
[79] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly8** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly8: Thank you. Question from me please on the cash channel. So yesterday, Novo stated it would make Ozempic available via its cash pay channel later this year. Are you planning to do the same for Mount Jaro? And if not, why not? And I’m not sure if you mentioned this earlier, but can you confirm whether you intend to use the cash channel for orfagliptron once that comes to market?

<a id="post-80"></a>
[80] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Great. Thanks, Kerry, for the question. We’ll go to Ilya to comment on our thoughts on the cash channel.

<a id="post-81"></a>
[81] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly0** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly0: Sure. Well, first, I think we’re learning a lot in the cash channel, movie direct. And a lot of that has to do with the consumer journey and it’s varied across different segments of where you have significant coverage versus not and with Mounjaro we have significant coverage, so over 90% coverage in both commercial as well as Part D. And so I’m not sure if that necessarily provides additional avenue. With that bound, we see significant growth because we do have coverage gaps in commercial and obviously, we also have coverage gaps without having the ability to cover anti obesity medications in Part D. So we see this as an opportunity for us to meet that need. Of course, we’ll evaluate other brands that we put through Direct. We have a number of avenues to come to Lily Direct on different brands to make sure that people can access the healthcare system in a better way. And so that’s something will evolve over time.

[82] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Great. Thanks, Ilya. And last question, please.

<a id="post-83"></a>
[83] **Conference Operator** Conference Operator: And final question today will be from Evan Seigerman from BMO Capital Markets. Evan, your line is live.

<a id="post-84"></a>
[84] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly3** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly3: Hi, guys. Thank you so much

<a id="post-85"></a>
[85] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly9** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly9: for taking my question. A follow-up on the MSN conversation. I appreciate you’re not going to share the details of your interaction with the administration, but can you provide some practical examples of what you and the industry can do to help achieve the goals of getting price parity globally. Thank you so much.

<a id="post-86"></a>
[86] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: Thanks, Evan. We’ll go to Dave to answer the question and then to provide closing remarks.

<a id="post-87"></a>
[87] **Dave Ricks, Chair and CEO, Eli Lilly** Dave Ricks, Chair and CEO, Eli Lilly: Yeah, sure. I don’t have a lot

<a id="post-88"></a>
[88] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly: to add to what I said

<a id="post-89"></a>
[89] **Conference Operator** Conference Operator: Certainly. At this time, we will be conducting a question and answer session. If you have any questions, please press star one on your phone at this time. We ask that participants limit themselves to one question on today’s call. And the first question today is coming from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.

<a id="post-90"></a>
[90] **Dave Ricks, Chair and CEO, Eli Lilly** Dave Ricks, Chair and CEO, Eli Lilly: to the prior question. I think long term, it makes sense to rebalance this. Having an on ramp makes sense to me because a sudden change in either environment would be difficult to sustain or justify. The idea of new products is a reasonable proposition, provided that the reimbursement rates in Europe can rise really based on cost for quality analysis and other things. And The US gross to net situation can change And easing into it seems to be a rational thing to do. The other piece which the DTC channel being suggested by the administration and for the prior question, in addition to offering an outlet for people who don’t have coverage, it does provide a kind of real price transparency to consumers, employers and others, and that’s a good thing. So we support that, as well. We’ll have to see how this plays out. As I said, we’re constructively engaging. Hopefully, some progress can be made. And I think it’s in the industry’s long term interest to kind of pull these things closer together and, we’ll work hard to try to do that. Thanks for being with us today everyone, and for as many questions as we got to. I know there’s always some we did not. So as in prior quarters, if you have unresolved questions, please contact our IR team. And, we appreciate your interest in the company as always and look forward to future interactions.

[91] **Mike Saffar, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Eli Lilly** Have a great day.

### Round 1

<a id="post-92"></a>
[92] **Healthcare Payer Analyst** [Risk] Orforglipron’s commercial upside is at risk because payers can blunt uptake via step edits, prior authorization, BMI/comorbidity restrictions and narrow formularies—driving lower real-world volume and forcing deeper net-price concessions; employer slow opt‑ins and cash/generic/compounding channels further amplify bargaining pressure [Status: UNKNOWN on specific PBM/or payer coverage rules for orforglipron] | Falsifier: major U.S. payers publicly commit broad coverage {Conf: Med} _(🔄 15)_

→ [View related research](#post-129)

<a id="post-93"></a>
[93] **Venture Partner, Biotech Funds** [Strength] Q2 materially expands Lilly's durable growth optionality: Verve adds potential one‑time genetic cures (PCSK9/ANGPTL3) creating high‑value pricing optionality; SiteOne brings a non‑opioid pain asset; ramp to ~1.8x incretin dose capacity plus Lilly Direct reduces supply/access constraints and supports differentiated channel pricing globally. | Falsifier: major divestiture or late‑stage failures announced {Conf: Med} _(🔄 4)_

→ [View related research](#post-117)

<a id="post-94"></a>
[94] **Chief Technology Officer, HealthTech Startup** [Strength] Lilly Direct integration with orforglipron is a high‑leverage commercial + clinical asset: owning the DTC channel creates a data feed for real‑time adherence support, AI‑driven titration, GI AE mitigation programs and payer-grade outcomes evidence that can lower discontinuations and accelerate reimbursement because it reduces downstream cost and uncertainty. [Status: UNKNOWN: extent of Lilly Direct-to-EMR/outcomes sharing] [Status: PROPRIETARY: platform capabilities] | Falsifier: publish null adherence/outcomes impact {Conf: Med} _(🔄 1)_

→ [View related research](#post-120)

<a id="post-95"></a>
[95] **Bioethicist** [Risk] Pivotal orforglipron disclosures note gender mix but lack full demographic/subgroup detail [Status: UNKNOWN]; underrepresentation of race/age/SES/comorbidity groups risks uncertain real‑world efficacy and safety because differing pharmacodynamics, comorbidity interactions, and access/adherence patterns can change outcomes. | Falsifier: publish detailed subgroup safety/efficacy analyses {Conf: Med} _(🔄 14)_

→ [View related research](#post-135)

<a id="post-96"></a>
[96] **Global Supply Chain Specialist** [Risk] Scaling oral incretin capacity relies on concentrated API/excipient sources and global logistics resilience—because regional supplier concentration (notably Asia) plus potential export controls, tariff shifts, or port/labor disruptions can bottleneck supply, delay launches, and increase COGS. [Status: PROPRIETARY supplier map; Tariff impact: INCONCLUSIVE] | Falsifier: publish multi‑region supplier list {Conf: High} _(🔄 13)_

→ [View related research](#post-127)

<a id="post-97"></a>
[97] **Patient Advocate (Obesity & Diabetes)** [Strength] Orforglipron’s oral once‑daily format likely lowers injection barriers and stigma—because convenience and fewer clinic interactions causally increase initiation/adherence—potentially expanding addressable market and improving equity; real‑world uptake and payer coverage remain [Status: UNKNOWN]. | Falsifier: no increase in unique patient starts {Conf: Med} _(🔄 4)_

→ [View related research](#post-133)

<a id="post-98"></a>
[98] **Actuary, Life/Reinsurance** [Risk] Rapid adoption of cardiometabolic therapies (tirzepatide, oral GLP‑1s) could materially reduce MACE and all‑cause mortality and thus increase long‑duration insurer liabilities—because fewer near‑term deaths shift cash flows, raise annuity/pension reserves and can produce adverse selection if pricing lags historical mortality assumptions. [Status: INCONCLUSIVE] | Falsifier: no cohort mortality decline within 3 years {Conf: Med} _(🔄 4)_

→ [View related research](#post-128)

<a id="post-99"></a>
[99] **Health Policy Strategist** [Risk] Lilly’s growing DTC/cash-channel transparency (Lilly Direct, vials) raises regulatory/political exposure because visible out‑of‑pocket pricing and claims of US‑EU disparity could trigger accelerated policy responses (mandatory parity, tougher Medicare negotiation, price controls) that compress net prices and margins. [Status: INCONCLUSIVE] | Falsifier: Administration publicly rules out parity moves {Conf: Med} _(🔄 2)_

→ [View related research](#post-123)

<a id="post-100"></a>
[100] **Institutional Pharma Sales Rep** [Risk] Hospital adoption of orforglipron may lag because institutional chronic‑care workflows, EMR order sets, reimbursement codes and specialist‑led clinics are optimized for injectables—absent clear formulary placement and outpatient dispensing plans [Status: UNKNOWN], in‑system starts could be delayed; recommend early hospital formulary engagement and EMR order‑set prep to reduce friction. | Falsifier: major hospital formulary additions pre-approval {Conf: Med} _(🔄 2)_

→ [View related research](#post-122)

<a id="post-101"></a>
[101] **Science Communications Educator** [Strength] Orforglipron’s ATTAIN‑one gives class‑consistent weight loss and cardiometabolic biomarker improvements in an oral small‑molecule—strength: because once‑daily pill reduces uptake barriers (needle aversion, clinic logistics) and small‑molecule chemistry scales manufacturing, it could materially widen access in primary care and cash channels; long‑term CV/mortality impact remains [Status: UNKNOWN]. | Falsifier: oral launches fail to raise prescriptions {Conf: Med} _(🔄 2)_

→ [View related research](#post-115)

<a id="post-102"></a>
[102] **Medical Devices Regulatory Specialist** [Risk] Growing reliance on PET and blood‑biomarker diagnostics to identify patients for Lilly’s neuroscience launch risks constrained uptake because diagnostics follow separate regulatory/validation pathways (LDT variability) and slower payer coverage/prior‑auth, creating a bottleneck despite drug approval. Recommend co‑development, harmonized labeling and early payer engagement. [Status: INCONCLUSIVE] | Falsifier: payers reimburse PET/blood biomarker tests widely {Conf: Med} _(🔄 2)_

→ [View related research](#post-124)

<a id="post-103"></a>
[103] **Market Access Consultant (Asia-Pacific)** [Strength] Orforglipron’s oral, small‑molecule profile materially expands APAC access potential—reduced cold‑chain and administration burden enables primary‑care prescribing, easier local manufacturing and tiered pricing, and faster scale to meet demand versus injectables (mechanism: lower distribution + admin cost → broader uptake). [Status: INCONCLUSIVE] | Falsifier: APAC prescriptions remain injectable‑dominant {Conf: Med}

<a id="post-104"></a>
[104] **Clinical Trials Auditor** [Risk] Key statistical methods (primary estimand and missing‑data handling) for ATTAIN‑one are not disclosed [Status: UNKNOWN]; because placebo discontinuation (29.9%) vs active (22–24%) is substantial, on‑treatment/completer analyses could upward‑bias efficacy if missingness is informative. | Falsifier: publish SAP/estimand details {Conf: High} _(🔄 18)_

→ [View related research](#post-136)

<a id="post-105"></a>
[105] **Behavioral Health Researcher** [Risk] Rapid, broad uptake of GLP‑1/incretin therapies may worsen population mental health and weight‑stigma dynamics because normalizing pharmacologic weight loss can shift societal expectations, amplify shame for non‑users or for those who regain weight, and increase demand for behavioral health services; long‑term real‑world psychosocial outcomes are [Status: UNKNOWN]. | Falsifier: national surveys show improved stigma and mental health {Conf: Med}

→ [View related research](#post-131)

<a id="post-106"></a>
[106] **Securities Litigation Analyst** [Risk] Management’s upbeat guidance and headline efficacy claims for orforglipron may create securities-class action/regulatory exposure because investors could allege materially misleading forward statements if underlying patient-level AEs, subgroup discontinuation drivers, or comparator-adjusted ITT results differ from summaries. Disclosure gaps: patient-level AE timing and adjudication [Status: UNKNOWN]; hepatic safety assertion [Status: UNVERIFIED]. | Falsifier: release patient-level AE and ITT data {Conf: Med} _(🔄 4)_

→ [View related research](#post-126)

<a id="post-107"></a>
[107] **Environmental Impact Assessor** [Risk] Lilly’s rapid scale‑up (1.6x→1.8x sellable incretin doses and two new U.S. plants) risks meaningful increases in solvent use, hazardous waste, wastewater contamination, and upstream GHGs because small‑molecule oral GLP‑1 synthesis is solvent‑ and energy‑intensive and purification scales nonlinearly; public lifecycle impacts and mitigation plans are not disclosed [Status: UNKNOWN]. | Falsifier: publish third‑party life‑cycle GHG and waste audit {Conf: Med} _(🔄 3)_

→ [View related research](#post-125)

<a id="post-108"></a>
[108] **Operations Director, API Manufacturing** [Risk] Lilly’s stated 1.6x H1 → 1.8x FY sellable-dose ramp risks critical supply-chain bottlenecks—API/excipient single-source dependency, vial and specialized fill‑finish capacity shortages, and long lead-times could cause production shortfalls or launch delays because these inputs are capital‑intensive and concentrated.

→ [View related research](#post-116)

<a id="post-109"></a>
[109] **Community Health Organizer** [Risk] Lilly Direct/cash‑vial strategy risks widening access gaps—because it depends on internet enrollment, cash/credit payment, local pharmacy stocking and employer/payer acceptance, so rural, low‑income, non‑English speaking and Medicaid patients may remain excluded [Status: UNKNOWN] | Falsifier: ≥50% DTC uptake in Medicaid/low‑income zip codes {Conf: Med} _(🔄 12)_

<a id="post-110"></a>
[110] **Sell-side Pharma Equity Analyst** [Strength] Lilly’s guidance raise plus plan to produce ≥1.8x sellable incretin doses in 2025 implies meaningful upside to FY25 revenue and non‑GAAP EPS from volume rather than price — oral orforglipron + DTC scale expands addressable market and supports margin expansion via mix and fixed‑cost absorption | Falsifier: fail to produce 1.8x sellable doses {Conf: Med}

<a id="post-111"></a>
[111] **ESG Fund Portfolio Manager** [Risk] Lilly’s plan to produce ~1.8x sellable incretin doses in 2025 lacks public incremental environmental footprint disclosures [Status: UNKNOWN]; scaling manufacturing (new US plants, higher small‑molecule and biologic output) causally increases energy, solvent, water use and waste generation, raising GHG, permitting, community‑health and remediation risks that could delay ramp and shift capital. | Falsifier: publish dose-level environmental impact metrics {Conf: Med} _(🔄 2)_

→ [View related research](#post-121)

<a id="post-112"></a>
[112] **Health Data Scientist** [Risk] SURPASS CVOT’s claim of cardioprotection rests on a pre-specified indirect matched comparison to putative placebo [Status: UNVERIFIED]; because there was no placebo arm, residual confounding, differing event definitions, and secular care differences can inflate apparent benefit—investors should demand patient‑level matching diagnostics, propensity overlap plots, and sensitivity analyses (E‑values, alternative matchers) before valuing an incremental survival benefit. | Falsifier: publish patient‑level matched analyses and sensitivity checks {Conf: High} _(🔄 19)_

<a id="post-113"></a>
[113] **Healthcare Antitrust Attorney** [Risk] Lilly’s 57%+ incretin share, recent buys (SiteOne, Verve) and vertical moves (Lilly Direct, scaling manufacturing) raise credible antitrust/remedy risk because high concentration plus vertical integration/foreclosure effects could prompt FTC/DOJ or foreign authority intervention, delaying launches or forcing divestitures [Status: INCONCLUSIVE] | Falsifier: antitrust agencies decline enforcement action {Conf: Med} _(🔄 8)_

<a id="post-114"></a>
[114] **Institutional Asset Allocator** [Balanced] Lilly's manufacturing ramp (1.6x sellable doses; guiding ≥1.8x) is a material strength—reducing supply risk and enabling faster global commercialization. Conversely, revenue concentration in incretins plus payer actions (CVS exclusion), cash-channel competition (compounding/Canadian generics) and potential international pricing reform create downside via fewer new starts and compressed net pricing [Status: INCONCLUSIVE] {Conf: Med}> | Falsifier: Q3 revenue growth <10% _(🔄 5)_

[115] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: Has Eli Lilly publicly released country-level launch plans, early prescription data, or primary-care prescribing share metrics for orforglipron in APAC markets by August 7, 2025 that demonstrate a shift from specialist/injectable prescribing to primary-care/oral prescribing; if so, what are the reported metrics by country? A: Short answer: No — I found no public, country-level APAC launch plans, early prescription figures, or primary‑care vs specialist prescribing‑share metrics from Eli Lilly as of August 7, 2025. Lilly’s public statements on that date report Phase‑3 results and say regulatory submissions and global launch planning are forthcoming (submissions “by year‑end”), and that orforglipron is not yet available—so no prescriber‑share rollouts or Rx data were published. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-delivers-weight-loss-average-273?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [lilly.com](https://www.lilly.com/news/stories/what-to-know-about-orforglipron?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can (a) search APAC regulator sites / Lilly country pages and local trade press for any subsequent country filings/early‑access announcements, or (b) monitor prescription data vendors (IQVIA) for early‑use metrics.

<a id="post-116"></a>
[116] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, what supplier sourcing information has Eli Lilly publicly disclosed for the key active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), excipients, and fill–finish capacity supporting the planned increase from ~1.6x H1 to a target ≥1.8x sellable incretin doses in 2025, including whether those inputs are single-sourced or multi-sourced and any identified capacity constraints? A: Short answer (≤150 words): As of Aug 7, 2025 Lilly’s public disclosures say it is expanding internal API and sterile‑injectable capacity (major investments in Indiana/Wisconsin/NC/Europe and four new U.S. “mega‑sites”) and is using/expanding external contract manufacturers to raise incretin output. Lilly’s SEC filings and press releases acknowledge dependence on third‑party suppliers (including China‑based suppliers) and “an extensive portfolio” of contract manufacturers, and media reports name partners such as National Resilience, BSP and WuXi AppTec for fill/finish or peptide work. Lilly has NOT published a granular, dose‑level supplier map or a public single‑source vs multi‑source list for specific APIs/excipients/fill‑finish lines; it also warns of periodic capacity tightness for certain presentations/doses.

[117] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: According to Eli Lilly's public disclosures related to its acquisitions, what are the primary indications, development or regulatory approval stage, and any disclosed commercialization timelines or pricing guidance for SiteOne’s non-opioid pain asset and Verve Therapeutics’ PCSK9/ANGPTL3 genetic therapy programs as of August 7, 2025? A: - SiteOne (STC‑004): primary indication — non‑opioid treatment for chronic pain (Nav1.8 sodium‑channel inhibitor). Development stage — Phase‑2 ready (Phase‑1 completed). Lilly disclosed the deal value "up to $1.0 billion" (upfront + regulatory/commercial milestones). Lilly did not disclose product commercialization timing or pricing guidance. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-expand-its-pain-pipeline-acquisition-siteone-therapeutics?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Verve (VERVE‑102 PCSK9; VERVE‑201 ANGPTL3): primary indications — VERVE‑102 for lowering LDL in HeFH and patients with premature CAD (later ASCVD); VERVE‑201 for refractory hypercholesterolemia and homozygous FH. Development/regulatory stage — VERVE‑102 in Phase 1b with FDA Fast Track; VERVE‑201 described as a development program (no Lilly statement of approval). Lilly disclosed a CVR tied to starting a U.S. Phase‑3 for VERVE‑102 within 10 years but gave no commercialization timing or pricing guidance.

[118] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: In Eli Lilly’s FY2025 guidance update to $60.0–$62.0 billion (announced August 7, 2025), did management quantify how much of the guidance raise was expected to come from incremental sellable-dose volume (e.g., ramp from 1.6x to ≥1.8x) versus price/mix and recent acquisitions; if so, what are the stated contributions or ranges? A: Short answer: No — management did not provide a dollar split showing how much of the $1.5B midpoint raise was from incremental sellable‑dose volume versus price/mix or acquisitions. Lilly said the raise was “primarily driven by strong underlying business performance across the portfolio and foreign exchange” and noted a ramp to at least 1.8x sellable incretin doses in 2025, but did not quantify components of the guidance uplift. Q2 detail: volume +42% / realized prices −6% (quarter).

[119] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, what public filings, statements, or formal actions (including dates and responsible authority) have the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, Department of Justice, or any major foreign competition authorities announced concerning antitrust or remedy reviews of Eli Lilly related to its incretin market share, Lilly Direct vertical integration, or the acquisitions of SiteOne and Verve? A: Short answer (as of Aug 7, 2025): I found no public FTC or DOJ complaint, court or agency enforcement action, or foreign competition remedy announced specifically challenging Eli Lilly on (a) incretin/GLP‑1 market dominance, (b) LillyDirect vertical‑integration, or (c) the SiteOne / Verve transactions. Public, attributable actions I did locate: - June 25, 2025 — Lilly/Verve submitted HSR pre‑merger notifications to the U.S. FTC and DOJ (schedule/offer disclosure). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000119312525146107/d948389dex99a1a.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - July 17, 2025 — U.S. Senate report (Durbin/Warren/Welch/Sanders) published critical findings about LillyDirect’s telehealth arrangements (congressional investigation, not an agency antitrust enforcement). ([durbin.senate.gov](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-sanders-warren-welch-release-investigative-report-on-pharmas-new-direct-to-consumer-telehealth-platforms?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Lilly announced the SiteOne (May 27, 2025) and Verve (Jun 17, 2025) deals and reported closing/completion activity in its Q2 2025 release; Lilly’s SEC filings also disclose prior subpoenas/CIDs from FTC and DOJ on related pricing matters (general inquiries, not public antitrust challenges tied to the items above).

[120] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What public disclosures has Eli Lilly made about the extent to which Lilly Direct shares patient adherence or outcomes data for orforglipron with electronic medical record (EMR) systems, healthcare providers, or payers (including data elements shared and any data-use agreements) as of August 7, 2025? A: Short answer (as of Aug 7, 2025): - Eli Lilly’s public LillyDirect materials and corporate privacy statements say Lilly may receive de‑identified or aggregated data from the third‑party telehealth/pharmacy partners and that it discloses personal data to “healthcare providers and pharmacies, at your direction.” They do not publish a line‑by‑line list of adherence/outcomes fields or EMR integration specs in those materials. ([lilly.com](https://www.lilly.com/find-care/faq?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [privacynotice.lilly.com](https://privacynotice.lilly.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - A July 17, 2025 Senate investigative report (Durbin et al.) states telehealth partners told investigators they transfer 21–28 data fields to the drugmakers (examples cited: demographics, BMI, A1C, weight, medication‑adherence metrics, contact info, prescription counts), but that allegation comes from the Senate report’s inquiry rather than a Lilly standalone disclosure. ([durbin.senate.gov](https://www.durbin.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/durbin-sanders-warren-welch-release-investigative-report-on-pharmas-new-direct-to-consumer-telehealth-platforms)) - I found no publicly posted Lilly data‑use agreements, EMR‑integration contracts, or a Lilly disclosure enumerating exact adherence/outcome elements or payer data flows for orforglipron as of Aug 7, 2025. (If you want, I can pull the specific Lilly privacy/FAQ passages and the Senate report PDF.)

[121] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly publicly disclosed incremental environmental footprint metrics associated with scaling incretin production to ≥1.8x sellable doses in 2025 (for example, dose-level energy consumption, solvent use, water use, hazardous waste generation, or incremental GHG emissions); if so, what are the published metrics or ranges? A: Short answer: No. As of Aug 7, 2025 Eli Lilly has not published dose‑level or explicit incremental environmental‑footprint metrics (e.g., per‑dose energy, solvent use, water use, hazardous waste, or incremental GHG tied to scaling incretin/GLP‑1 production to ≥1.8× sellable doses). Lilly’s public disclosures provide corporate‑level energy, water, GHG and waste data (2024 Sustainability Report) and it has publicly announced major capacity increases for GLP‑1/incretin supply (~50–60%+ higher sellable doses), but those materials do not report product‑ or dose‑level incremental LCA/footprint figures. ([sustainability.lilly.com](https://sustainability.lilly.com/environmental/climate?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-provides-update-2024-revenue-guidance-announces-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [biopharmadive.com](https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/lilly-zepbound-mounjaro-supply-manufacturing-expansion/714722/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you’d like, I can (a) search for any third‑party LCAs/academic analyses of GLP‑1 manufacturing footprints, or (b) file a targeted request to Lilly press/investor relations for product‑level LCA data.

A: Short answer: I could not find any public announcements (press release, formulary notice, or EMR/order‑set bulletin) from major U.S. hospital systems or integrated delivery networks specifically naming orforglipron for formulary placement, inpatient/outpatient dispensing, or EMR order‑set integration as of Aug 7, 2025. Orforglipron remained investigational with Lilly planning regulatory submissions later in 2025, and health systems/insurers were issuing broader GLP‑1/anti‑obesity coverage policies rather than drug‑specific hospital formulary/EMR actions.

[123] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, have any U.S. federal agencies or policymakers publicly proposed or enacted regulations requiring price parity between direct-to-consumer (cash) prescription pricing and negotiated payer prices, or otherwise announced policy changes specifically in response to visible DTC pricing for incretin therapies; if so, what are the proposals or rules and their effective timelines? A: Short answer: No — as of August 7, 2025 no U.S. agency had finalized a regulation that expressly requires price‑parity between direct‑to‑consumer (cash) prescription prices and negotiated payer prices. Relevant public actions (not parity mandates) - Presidential EO (May 12, 2025) directed HHS to push manufacturers to match “most‑favored‑nation” prices and to “facilitate direct‑to‑consumer purchasing” and ordered HHS to consider rulemaking if manufacturers don’t comply. ([whitehouse.gov](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/05/delivering-most-favored-nation-prescription-drug-pricing-to-american-patients/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - HHS/CMS set MFN targets and signaled follow‑on actions in May 2025, but did not publish a rule forcing DTC/payer price parity. ([hhs.gov](https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/cms-mfn-lower-us-drug-prices.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - CMS’s Inflation‑Reduction‑Act negotiation included semaglutide products (Ozempic/Wegovy/Rybelsus); those negotiated prices become effective Jan 1, 2027. Separately, reporting says CMMI is eyeing a voluntary pilot to let some Medicaid (April 2026 start reported) and Medicare plans (Jan 2027 reported) cover GLP‑1s. These are policy steps responsive to DTC/incretin pricing, not an explicit DTC‑to‑payer parity rule. ([cms.gov](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/cms-announces-manufacturer-participation-second-cycle-medicare-drug-price-negotiation?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/08/01/medicare-medicaid-weight-loss-drugs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can monitor rulemakings and public dockets and send updates.

[124] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: For Lilly neuroscience programs that rely on PET or blood-biomarker diagnostics, what public disclosures has Eli Lilly made as of August 7, 2025 regarding payer reimbursement coverage, co-development agreements with diagnostics providers, or planned labeling to facilitate payer coverage of the diagnostic tests required for patient identification? A: Short answer (as of Aug 7, 2025): - Payer reimbursement: Lilly publicly stated that Medicare coverage/reimbursement pathways exist for Kisunla (donanemab)—noting Medicare’s NCD/Coverage‑with‑Evidence‑Development for anti‑amyloid mAbs and that broad Medicare coverage for amyloid PET was in place (Lilly cited CMS policy). ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-kisunlatm-donanemab-azbt-approved-fda-treatment-early?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [cms.gov](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-finalizes-medicare-coverage-policy-monoclonal-antibodies-directed-against-amyloid-treatment?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Co‑development agreements: Lilly disclosed formal collaborations with diagnostics firms (notably Roche on the Elecsys amyloid/p‑tau plasma assays) and has non‑exclusive arrangements/partners for plasma p‑tau development (e.g., public coverage of Lilly–Roche collaboration). ([roche.com](https://www.roche.com/media/releases/med-cor-2023-03-22?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Labeling to facilitate diagnostic coverage: Lilly’s prescribing information and public materials state treatment requires “confirmed amyloid pathology” prior to initiation (the label references amyloid PET as a basis for treatment decisions), which aligns with facilitating payer coverage of testing. ([medical.lilly.com](https://medical.lilly.com/us/products/answers/is-evidence-of-amyloid-pathology-required-to-use-kisunla-donanemab-azbt-213331?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-kisunlatm-donanemab-azbt-approved-fda-treatment-early?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can pull the specific Lilly press‑releases/PI excerpts and CMS policy text (PDFs) for direct quotes.

[125] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: Has Eli Lilly published a third-party life-cycle assessment or external audit quantifying greenhouse-gas emissions, solvent use, hazardous waste generation, and wastewater impacts associated with scaling oral incretin manufacturing to support an approximately 1.8x sellable-dose capacity in 2025; if so, what are the principal quantified findings? A: Short answer: No authoritative, third‑party life‑cycle assessment or external audit specifically quantifying GHGs, solvent use, hazardous‑waste generation, and wastewater from scaling Eli Lilly’s oral‑incretin manufacturing to ~1.8× sellable‑dose capacity in 2025 is publicly available as of Aug 9, 2025. Lilly publishes corporate‑level sustainability reporting (with limited assurance on some environmental metrics) and has disclosed planned production increases (~+60% / ~1.6× in 1H‑2025), but I found no public, third‑party cradle‑to‑gate LCA or external audit focused on the incretin scale‑up and the exact metrics you list. ([sustainability.lilly.com](https://sustainability.lilly.com/environmental?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-provides-update-2024-revenue-guidance-announces-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Context: sector studies note large solvent and waste intensities for peptide manufacture generally, but those are academic/industry analyses, not an Eli Lilly third‑party audit of their 2025 scale‑up. ([cen.acs.org](https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/pharmaceutical-chemicals/making-weight-loss-drugs-mean/102/i13?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [sciencedirect.com](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624030257?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can (a) search for any non‑public filings/assurance statements or (b file a targeted FOIA/registry search for third‑party reports.

[126] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: Have any securities-class action lawsuits, SEC investigations, or other regulatory enforcement matters been publicly filed or announced against Eli Lilly related specifically to disclosures about orforglipron efficacy, safety, or forward-looking guidance as of August 7, 2025; if so, what are the filing dates and brief descriptions of the claims? A: Short answer: I found no public securities‑class action filings, SEC investigations, or other regulatory enforcement matters publicly announced that specifically allege wrongdoing in Eli Lilly’s disclosures about orforglipron as of August 7, 2025. Lilly issued the ATTAIN‑1 topline release on Aug 7 and major outlets reported the trial results and the stock drop but did not report any orforglipron‑related securities suits or SEC probes that day. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-delivers-weight-loss-average-273?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/drugmakers-racing-launch-first-weight-loss-pill-2025-08-07/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you’d like, I can run deeper legal-database searches (PACER, Bloomberg Law, SEC enforcement docket) and report any filings announced after Aug 7 (or any I may have missed).

<a id="post-127"></a>
[127] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: Has Eli Lilly published a multi-region supplier list or disclosed the geographic concentration (by country or region) of suppliers for key APIs and excipients used in orforglipron manufacturing as of August 7, 2025; if so, what is the reported share sourced from each region (for example, percentage from Asia vs North America/Europe)? A: Short answer: No public Lilly disclosure locating a company-published, multi‑region supplier list or a percentage breakdown (Asia vs. North America/Europe) for the specific APIs/excipients used to make orforglipron was found as of August 7, 2025. Lilly’s public supply‑chain materials and SEC filings discuss global suppliers and note reliance on China for some inputs but do not report region-by-region percentage shares for orforglipron. Third‑party supplier directories list many orforglipron/API intermediates suppliers in Asia (China), but those are not Lilly‑issued, company‑verified regional shares. ([sustainability.lilly.com](https://sustainability.lilly.com/governance/supply-chain-management?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947825000067/lly-20241231.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [pharmacompass.com](https://www.pharmacompass.com/manufacturers-suppliers-exporters/ly3502970-orforglipron?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can (a) search regulatory filings (CMC/NDA documents) or recent Lilly press filings for any updates through Aug 9, 2025, or (b) assemble third‑party supplier-location data for intermediates/APIs. Which would you prefer?

[128] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: Have any actuarial bodies, major life-insurance companies, or pension-plan sponsors publicly quantified changes to mortality assumptions or reserve requirements that they attribute to broad adoption of GLP‑1/incretin therapies as of August 7, 2025; if so, what changes (for example, percentage change in mortality rates or reserve increases) have been reported? A: Short answer: Very few. Munich Re is a notable exception — its public analysis (Mar–May 2025) modelled a hypothetical 21% all‑cause mortality reduction for “non‑severely” obese and ~40% for “severely” obese over 10–20 years (and estimated this could add ~0.3–0.7 percentage points to expected annual mortality‑improvement from obesity‑drug effects). Other reinsurers/insurers (Swiss Re, Gallagher Re, consultancies) have published scenario analyses or cost‑trend estimates, and actuarial bodies (SOA) have opened research projects — but I found no broad, public announcements by major life insurers or pension sponsors of formal mortality‑table changes or reserve increases explicitly attributed to GLP‑1 adoption as of Aug 7, 2025 (e.g., RGA said it had not yet reflected GLP‑1 impacts). ([munichre.com](https://www.munichre.com/en/company/media-relations/media-information-and-corporate-news/corporate-news/2025/2025-03-03-new-drugs-against-obesity-are-working.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [loma.org](https://www.loma.org/en/news/marketfacts/2025/obesity-drugs-and-insurance-navigating-emerging-trends/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [marketbeat.com](https://www.marketbeat.com/earnings/reports/2025-5-1-reinsurance-group-of-america-incorporated-stock/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

[129] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, what specific formulary coverage policies have major U.S. pharmacy benefit managers and payers (for example, CVS Caremark, Cigna/Express Scripts, and UnitedHealthcare) publicly announced for orforglipron, including any step-therapy requirements, prior-authorization criteria, BMI or comorbidity restrictions, and formulary tier placement? A: Short answer: As of Aug 7, 2025, I found no public, orforglipron‑specific formulary coverage policies (no posted prior‑auth, step‑therapy, BMI/comorbidity rules, or tier placements) from CVS Caremark, Cigna/Express Scripts or UnitedHealthcare. Orforglipron remains investigational with Lilly planning regulatory submissions later in 2025, so PBMs appear to be awaiting FDA action before publishing drug‑specific policies. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-delivers-weight-loss-average-273?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [lilly.com](https://www.lilly.com/news/stories/what-to-know-about-orforglipron?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Context/sources for related policy patterns: major PBMs have already published GLP‑1 coverage frameworks that use prior authorization, BMI thresholds (e.g., BMI ≥30 or ≥27 with comorbidity) and step‑therapy for existing GLP‑1s — indicating how they are likely to approach a new GLP‑1 after approval. (See CVS Caremark formulary actions and UnitedHealthcare prior‑auth GLP‑1 guidance.) ([managedhealthcareexecutive.com](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/cvs-caremark-to-place-wegovy-as-preferred-glp-1-for-weight-loss?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [uhcprovider.com](https://www.uhcprovider.com/en/resource-library/news/2023/prior-auth-glucagon-like-peptide-1-medications.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can recheck specific PBM formulary pages and client templates (plan‑level rules vary) and return detailed screenshots/links.

[130] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: Has Eli Lilly published demographic, payer-mix, or geographic breakdowns (for example, Medicaid share, rural vs urban zip-code enrollment, or language distribution) of enrollees or prescription volumes through Lilly Direct for orforglipron or other Lilly Direct programs as of August 7, 2025; if so, what are the reported percentages or counts by category? A: Short answer (as of Aug 7, 2025): No — Eli Lilly has not published public demographic, payer‑mix or geographic breakdowns (e.g., Medicaid share, rural/urban zip‑code splits, language distribution or counts) of LillyDirect enrollees or prescription volumes. Lilly’s LillyDirect pages and company releases describe the service but do not provide those disaggregated statistics, and press coverage notes Lilly has not disclosed user/enrollee counts. Analysts have reported prescription‑volume trends (e.g., a cited 178% quarter‑over‑quarter jump in scripts routed via LillyDirect), but that reporting does not include payer or demographic breakdowns. ([lilly.com](https://www.lilly.com/lillydirect/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com/eli-lilly-amazon-partner-for-direct-to-consumer-delivery-of-zepbound-other-drugs-8608454?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/citi-bullish-on-lilly-as-orforglipron-unlocks-40b-obesity-market-4110101?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can (a) search deeper for state/Medicaid formulary notices that mention LillyDirect volumes, or (b) draft a records request/press query you could send Lilly for these specific breakdowns.

[131] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, are there nationally representative survey or epidemiologic data publicly available that quantify changes in population-level mental health measures or weight-stigma indicators attributable to the rapid adoption of GLP‑1/incretin therapies; if so, what are the observed changes (for example, percentage-point changes in reported anxiety, depression, or stigma measures) and their data sources? A: Short answer: No — as of Aug 7, 2025 there are nationally representative data reporting GLP‑1 use and population mental‑health trends, and nationally representative surveys of self‑reported effects among users, but no publicly available nationally representative dataset that credibly quantifies population‑level changes in anxiety/depression or weight‑stigma that are causally attributed to the rapid uptake of GLP‑1/incretin therapies. Key public sources and observed measures: - KFF Health Tracking Poll (May 2024): 12% of U.S. adults report ever taking a GLP‑1; 6% currently taking one (use prevalence). ([kff.org](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-may-2024-the-publics-use-and-views-of-glp-1-drugs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Kinsey Institute nationally representative survey (July 2025, singles): among GLP‑1 users 59% reported ≥1 dating/social impact; item-level effects (e.g., 17% bought new clothes, 14% got more dating‑app matches, ~12–13% reported greater confidence). ([news.iu.edu](https://news.iu.edu/kinseyinstitute/live/news/46263-survey-shows-glp-1-weight-loss-drugs-are-changing?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - SAMHSA/NSDUH (2024 national release): overall adult AMI stable (23.4% in 2024 vs prior years); adolescent major depressive episode fell 20.8%→15.4% (−5.4 percentage points) 2021→2024 — but NSDUH does not attribute these changes to GLP‑1 uptake. ([samhsa.gov](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/nsduh-national-survey-drug-use-and-health/national-releases/2024?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Bottom line: available national surveys report GLP‑1 prevalence and user‑reported psychosocial effects and show recent mental‑health trend estimates, but no nationally representative study as of Aug 7, 2025 has published population‑level changes explicitly attributed to GLP‑1 adoption (causal claims remain speculative).

[132] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What percentage of Eli Lilly’s reported Q2 2025 revenues ($15.56 billion) was attributed to incretin products (including tirzepatide and orforglipron) according to Lilly’s public financial disclosures for the quarter ended June 30, 2025? A: Mounjaro ($5,198.9M) + Zepbound ($3,381.4M) = $8,580.3M of $15.56B → 8,580.3 / 15,560 = 55.2% (≈55.1–55.2%). Lilly’s Q2 2025 release lists those tirzepatide products; orforglipron had no reported product sales in the Selected Products table for the quarter.

[133] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What empirical evidence (for example, trial-based initiation rates, adherence rates, or comparative real-world prescription data) has Eli Lilly published by August 7, 2025 comparing patient initiation and adherence for oral orforglipron versus injectable incretin therapies, and what are the reported quantitative differences? A: Short answer: As of Aug 7, 2025 Eli Lilly has not published any empirical, head‑to‑head data (trial initiation rates, trial adherence curves, or real‑world prescription/adherence comparisons) that directly compare patient initiation or adherence of oral orforglipron versus injectable incretin therapies. Lilly’s public documents report trial discontinuation/tolerability numbers for orforglipron (not comparisons to injectables) — e.g. ATTAIN‑1 (obesity): overall discontinuation 21.9–24.4% (orforglipron doses) vs 29.9% (placebo); discontinuations due to AEs 5.1–10.3% vs 2.6% placebo. ACHIEVE‑1 (T2D) reported AE‑related discontinuations 4–8% across doses. Lilly also states the safety/tolerability profile is “consistent with injectable GLP‑1” but provides no quantitative initiation/adherence comparison.

[135] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: Has Eli Lilly publicly released detailed demographic and subgroup efficacy and safety analyses (including breakdowns by race/ethnicity, age categories, socioeconomic status proxies, and major comorbidity subgroups) from the pivotal orforglipron trials as of August 7, 2025; if so, what are the key subgroup effect estimates and sample sizes? A: Short answer: Partial. - ACHIEVE‑1 (type 2 diabetes): Lilly published the phase‑3 paper (N=559) with baseline demographic tables (race/ethnicity, age) and overall efficacy/safety; arm sizes were orforglipron 3/12/36 mg = 143/137/141 and placebo = 138. However, the public report/Supplement provides limited formal subgroup effect estimates (race, SES proxies, comorbidity strata) beyond standard age/sex summaries. ([ovid.com](https://www.ovid.com/journals/nejm/abstract/10.1056/nejmoa2505669~orforglipron-an-oral-small-molecule-glp-1-receptor-agonist?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [medical.lilly.com](https://medical.lilly.com/us/products/answers/in-achieve-1-how-did-orforglipron-compare-with-placebo-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-inadequately-controlled-with-diet-and-exercise-274207?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - ATTAIN‑1 (obesity; N=3,127): Lilly’s Aug 7, 2025 topline release gave overall efficacy/safety results but did not include full, detailed subgroup effect estimates or complete breakdowns by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic‑status proxies, or comprehensive comorbidity subgroup effect tables in the public release as of Aug 7, 2025.

[136] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What statistical analysis plan (SAP) details has Eli Lilly publicly disclosed for the ATTAIN-one orforglipron trial as of August 7, 2025, specifically the pre-specified primary estimand and the planned missing-data handling methods (e.g., multiple imputation, mixed-model repeated measures, treatment-policy/efficacy estimand)? A: Short answer (as of Aug 7, 2025): Eli Lilly publicly stated that ATTAIN‑1 used an "efficacy" estimand for the primary analysis (and also reported a separate "treatment‑regimen" estimand), defining the efficacy estimand as the effect “had all randomized participants remained on study intervention … for 72 weeks without initiating prohibited weight‑management treatments.” Lilly’s August‑7,‑2025 releases do not publish the trial SAP or specify the planned missing‑data method (e.g., MMRM, multiple imputation, or a treatment‑policy strategy) for ATTAIN‑1. I could not find a public ATTAIN‑1 SAP or protocol text disclosing those missing‑data procedures as of that date.

[160] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: According to Eli Lilly’s public Q2 2025 disclosures, what percentage of Q2 2025 revenue was attributed to incretin products (including tirzepatide and any disclosed orforglipron sales) and what full‑year 2025 revenue guidance range did the company announce on August 7, 2025? A: Per Eli Lilly’s Q2 2025 release (Aug 7, 2025), Mounjaro ($5,198.9M) + Zepbound ($3,381.4M) totaled $8,580.3M, or 55.15% of Q2 revenue ($15,557.7M); the Q2 filing did not disclose any orforglipron sales. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-second-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-raises?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Lilly also raised full‑year 2025 revenue guidance to a range of $60.0 billion to $62.0 billion on August 7, 2025.

[161] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, are there nationally representative surveys or epidemiologic studies that attribute population‑level changes in mental health measures or weight‑stigma indicators to the adoption of GLP‑1/incretin therapies; if such studies exist, what quantitative changes (for example, percentage‑point changes in reported anxiety, depression, or stigma measures) and what data sources and methodologies were reported? A: Short answer: Yes — several nationally‑representative surveys report self‑reported psychosocial impacts of GLP‑1 use, and at least one large epidemiologic claims study reports higher incidence/hazard of psychiatric diagnoses among GLP‑1 users; most studies are associative (not proof of causation). Key examples (methods + quantitative findings) - Kinsey Institute nationally‑representative online survey (n=2,000; Apr–May 2025): 8% reported GLP‑1 use; among users 59% reported ≥1 dating/psychosocial impact (examples: 13% felt more confident posting photos; men reporting fear of being judged 60% vs women 35%). ([news.iu.edu](https://news.iu.edu/kinseyinstitute/live/news/46263-survey-shows-glp-1-weight-loss-drugs-are-changing?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - KFF Health Tracking Poll (May 2024; national): prevalence/about‑use estimates (12% ever taken; 6% currently), used as population context in many analyses. ([kff.org](https://www.kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-may-2024-the-publics-use-and-views-of-glp-1-drugs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Large claims‑based cohort (TrinetX; 2015–2023) with 1:1 propensity matching (n≈162,253 pairs) found higher incidence of psychiatric outcomes in GLP‑1 RA users (1‑year incidence 15.29% vs 7.63% — ≈+7.7 percentage points; HR any psychiatric disorder 1.98; HR major depression 2.95).

[162] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly publicly disclosed contractual arrangements or announced manufacturing partnerships with Resilience, WuXi, or other contract manufacturing organizations in support of incretin production; if so, what capacities (for example, annual sellable doses), scope (API, drug‑product, fill–finish), and contract timelines did Lilly disclose and where are those disclosures available? A: Short answer (as of Aug 7, 2025): Yes — major media and CDMO disclosures show Lilly has used/arranged with contract manufacturers to scale incretin supply, but Lilly itself typically declines to name counterparties in public releases. What’s public: - Financial Times and industry press reported Lilly arrangements with National Resilience (fill/finish) and BSP Pharmaceuticals (fill–finish). FT reported Resilience would fill Zepbound pens and BSP capacity plans (FT coverage). ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/f7bc9af9-4643-481a-94e8-ac87547123a8?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - National Resilience’s Feb 20, 2024 press release publicly states its network will scale to “over 200 million units” by 2025 and calls out GLP‑1 demand (fill/finish capacity). (Resilience did not name Lilly in that release). ([resilience.com](https://resilience.com/news/drug-product-expansion?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Lilly’s investor/earnings disclosures confirm broad use of external contract manufacturers, large API/drug‑product investments and timelines (e.g., Lebanon API site coming online ~2026; Lilly reported 1.6x salable‑dose production in 1H‑2025 vs 1H‑2024). Lilly has not publicly published a detailed CMO contract showing explicit sellable‑dose counts, full scope (API vs drug‑product vs fill–finish) or commercial contract timelines.

A: Short answer — as disclosed by Eli Lilly (and listing the trial registry IDs): - ATTAIN‑1 (NCT05869903, adults with obesity/overweight without diabetes): 3,127 randomized. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-delivers-weight-loss-average-273?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - ACHIEVE‑1 (NCT05971940, adults with type 2 diabetes): 559 randomized.

[164] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, what percentage of U.S. orforglipron prescriptions (or prescription starts) were initiated by primary care physicians versus specialists according to publicly available prescribing datasets, payer disclosures, or Eli Lilly public statements, and what is the data source and date range for those figures? A: Short answer: None — I could not find any publicly reported percentages (PCP vs specialist) for orforglipron prescription starts as of August 7, 2025. Eli Lilly notes orforglipron was investigational/not commercially available (Lilly FAQ, updated June 21, 2025) and announced Phase‑3 topline results on Aug 7, 2025 while planning regulatory submissions — not commercial prescribing disclosures. Public specialty‑level prescribing figures would normally come from commercial prescription datasets (e.g., IQVIA NPA) but I found no IQVIA/claims/payer report showing orforglipron starts through Aug 7, 2025. ([lilly.com](https://www.lilly.com/news/stories/what-to-know-about-orforglipron?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-delivers-weight-loss-average-273?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9238581/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can (a) check specific commercial data vendors (IQVIA, Symphony/SRX, Clarivate) for paid reports or (b) monitor for Lilly/payer disclosures after regulatory filing/launch.

[165] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly publicly provided quantitative estimates of incremental revenue or earnings-per-share (EPS) contribution tied to orforglipron capturing a 5–10% share of total incretin TRx in year one; if so, what are the stated revenue and EPS ranges and the underlying assumptions (price, margin, tax)? A: Short answer: No. Eli Lilly’s public filings and investor materials through Aug 7, 2025 do not publish a scenario that quantifies incremental revenue or EPS specifically tied to orforglipron capturing “5–10% of total incretin TRx in year one.” Lilly has issued company-level 2025 guidance (updated Aug 7, 2025) — revenue $60–62B; reported EPS $20.85–22.10 (non‑GAAP $21.75–23.00); reported performance‑margin and tax assumptions are stated in that release — but it does not break out a 5–10% TRx market‑share / year‑one revenue or EPS sensitivity for orforglipron.

[166] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, have any major U.S. payers or pharmacy benefit managers publicly announced outcomes-based/value-based contracts for tirzepatide that tie reimbursement to reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) or all-cause mortality; if so, which organizations announced such contracts and what are the contract terms (specified endpoints, measurement period, covered populations, and financial adjustment mechanics)? A: Short answer: No. I found no public announcement (through Aug 7, 2025) from any major U.S. payer or PBM that a contract for tirzepatide ties reimbursement to reductions in MACE or all‑cause mortality. Major payers/PBMs have announced financial-guarantee / program approaches (e.g., Evernorth/Express Scripts’ EncircleRx cost caps and patient‑support programs) and formulary actions (e.g., CVS Caremark’s July 1, 2025 formulary change for Zepbound), but these do not specify MACE or mortality endpoints, measurement windows, covered‑population definitions, or payment‑adjustment mechanics in the public disclosures. It remains possible that confidential, sponsor‑level value arrangements exist but none were publicly reported by major payers/PBMs as of Aug 7, 2025.

A: Short answer (as of Aug 7, 2025): - 70% list‑price reduction: Lilly publicly announced cutting list prices of its most‑commonly prescribed insulins by 70% (press release, Mar 1, 2023). ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-cuts-insulin-prices-70-and-caps-patient-insulin-out-pocket/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - $35 cap — program size/enrollment disclosures: Lilly’s public releases state the $35 Lilly Insulin Value Program (launched Apr 7, 2020) and, in Sept 2020, said its affordability efforts were “helping up to 20,000 people each month.” Lilly also reported (Sept 28, 2021) that its lower‑list‑priced Insulin Lispro had been “adopted by a third of Humalog U‑100 consumers.” ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/new-35-co-pay-now-available-through-lilly-insulin-value-program?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - LillyDirect average discount: Lilly has disclosed specific LillyDirect/self‑pay discounts (e.g., certain Zepbound single‑dose vials offered at “50% or greater” discount vs. other incretin list prices) but has not published a single overall “average percent discount” number for all LillyDirect programs.

[168] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly publicly released environmental design specifications, targets, or lifecycle‑assessment metrics for its new U.S. greenfield incretin manufacturing plants (for example, projected solvent‑recovery rates, projected greenhouse‑gas emissions per dose, water use per dose, or hazardous‑waste targets); if so, what quantified metrics or targets were disclosed and where are they published? A: Short answer (as of August 7, 2025): No — I found no public, Lilly‑published plant‑level environmental design specifications or full lifecycle‑assessment metrics (e.g., solvent‑recovery rates, GHG or water use per dose, hazardous‑waste per dose) for the new U.S. greenfield incretin plants. Lilly’s public disclosures are corporate/goal‑level (2030 carbon‑neutrality, 100% renewable electricity, zero routine landfill, etc.) and permit filings/public notices for specific sites do disclose operational projections (water allocations, draft air/wastewater permit limits and emissions estimates) but not the per‑dose or detailed solvent‑recovery/LCA numbers the examples ask about.

[170] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, what public disclosures has Eli Lilly made about the planned capacity (for example, annual sellable‑dose output) and operational timelines for the Research Triangle Park facility and the two planned U.S. manufacturing plants that contribute to the company’s stated ramp from ~1.6× to ≥1.8× sellable incretin doses in 2025? A: Short answer: Lilly has publicly reported percentage ramps and facility timelines but has not published explicit annual "sellable‑dose" throughput numbers for the Research Triangle Park (RTP) expansion or for the new U.S. plants as of Aug 7, 2025. Specifically, Lilly told investors it would produce at least ~1.6× (≈60% more) salable incretin doses in H1 2025 vs H1 2024, announced a $450M RTP parenteral expansion (initial production referenced in earlier releases; a later phase “fully operational” date was projected), and said it would begin building multiple new U.S. sites in 2025 — but did not disclose per‑site annual dose outputs or a public schedule tying those two (or any two) specific planned plants to a stated move from ~1.6× to ≥1.8×.

[171] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly published the short standardized dashboard metrics requested by investors (6‑ and 12‑month real‑world adherence, primary‑care vs specialist initiation %, Lilly Direct payer/demographic breakdown, and country‑level launch timelines) for orforglipron or other incretin therapies; if so, provide the reported metrics, date ranges, and links to those dashboards or reports. A: Short answer: No — I could not find any public “short standardized” investor dashboard from Eli Lilly (as of Aug 7, 2025) that reports the exact set you list (6‑ and 12‑month real‑world adherence, PCP vs specialist initiation %, LillyDirect payer/demographic breakdown, and country‑level launch timelines) for orforglipron or its incretin portfolio. I found clinical releases and some product‑level real‑world summaries but not a consolidated investor dashboard. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-demonstrated-statistically?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) What Lilly has published (examples) - Orforglipron Phase‑3/press releases (ACHIEVE/ATTAIN results; Apr 17, Jun 21, Aug 7, 2025). These are clinical trial results, not an operational dashboard. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-demonstrated-statistically?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - LillyDirect launch announcement (Jan 4, 2024) — describes the program but no public payer/demographic dashboard. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-launches-end-end-digital-healthcare-experience-through/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Lilly real‑world data press items (e.g., Trulicity adherence/persistence comparisons at 6 months and 1 year) — product‑specific RWE but not the investor dashboard you described. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/real-world-data-show-advantages-people-treated-lillys-once?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can (a) search for private investor presentations or decks Lilly may have shared with investors, or (b) assemble available third‑party real‑world metrics (claims/PDMP/IQVIA/NMCI) matched to your requested fields. Which do you prefer?

[172] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, what public collaborations or agreements has Eli Lilly announced with diagnostics providers (for example, Roche Elecsys) to support plasma or PET assays required for donanemab patient selection, and what public information exists regarding payer reimbursement coverage (including any CMS decisions) for those diagnostic tests? A: Short answer (as of Aug 7, 2025): - Eli Lilly has publicly announced collaborations to support plasma and PET assays for donanemab patient selection: a formal collaboration with Roche on the Elecsys amyloid/pTau plasma assays (announced Mar 22, 2023; Elecsys pTau217 received FDA Breakthrough Device designation Apr 11, 2024), and a 2022 license/collaboration with Quanterix to use Lilly p‑tau217 antibody technology in Simoa plasma assays used in donanemab studies. ([roche.com](https://www.roche.com/media/releases/med-cor-2023-03-22?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [quanterix.com](https://www.quanterix.com/press-releases/quanterix-announces-new-agreements-with-lilly-to-advance-alzheimers-disease-diagnosis-and-treatment/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Payer status: CMS retired the national CED NCD for beta‑amyloid PET (effective Oct 13, 2023); Medicare Administrative Contractors now make local coverage decisions for amyloid PET. There is no comparable national CMS coverage decision approving plasma p‑tau/amyloid blood tests — public literature and stakeholder reviews (2024–2025) report that public and private payers generally have not adopted routine coverage for blood‑based AD biomarker tests pending evidence of clinical utility. ([cms.gov](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-finalizes-medicare-coverage-policy-monoclonal-antibodies-directed-against-amyloid-treatment?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11631638/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can pull specific Lilly, Roche, Quanterix press releases or MAC local-coverage examples.

[173] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, have any major insurers publicly announced pilots of value‑based insurance products tied to measurable outcomes from incretin therapies (for example, outcome‑linked premiums, obesity‑therapy riders, or longevity‑adjusted annuities); if so, which insurers announced pilots, what endpoints and evaluation periods were specified, and what are the planned timelines? A: Short answer: No major U.S. insurer had publicly announced an explicit pilot that ties individual insurance premiums, annuity payouts, or a formal “outcome‑linked premium” / longevity‑adjusted annuity to measurable patient outcomes from incretin (GLP‑1/tirzepatide‑class) therapy as of Aug 7, 2025. Instead payers have launched cost‑caps, employer optional riders or program performance guarantees (not individual premium/annuity pilots). For example, Cigna/Evernorth’s EncircleRx offers employer cost caps and program performance guarantees with tracked endpoints (weight loss, A1c, admissions) (Evernorth press release). Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts moved to make GLP‑1 weight‑loss coverage optional for large employers (effective on renewals beginning Jan 1, 2026). The federal CMMI/Medicare‑Medicaid pilot to test covering GLP‑1s was being proposed in 2025 (insurers may opt in). ([evernorth.com](https://www.evernorth.com/articles/evernorth-announces-industry-first-financial-guarantee-glp-1-spend?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [bluecrossma.org](https://www.bluecrossma.org/glp-1-coverage-update?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [washingtonpost.com](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/08/01/medicare-medicaid-weight-loss-drugs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can track daily news for any insurer announcements after Aug 7, 2025.

[174] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, what specific operational adaptations has Eli Lilly publicly described for Lilly Direct to serve Medicaid beneficiaries and populations with low digital access (for example, phone enrollment, multilingual outreach, Medicaid billing capability, or community‑pharmacy fulfillment), and what implementation dates or enrollment/coverage metrics (if any) were disclosed? A: Short answer (≤150 words): Publicly disclosed LillyDirect adaptations (and dates/metrics) as of Aug 7, 2025: - Pharmacy/insurance workflow: LillyDirect routes prescriptions to third‑party dispensers (Truepill, EVERSANA and, since Mar 13, 2024, Amazon Pharmacy) that provide home mail‑delivery and integrate with insurance adjudication; LillyDirect says patients can use major insurance plans or self‑pay and that Lilly savings cards are applied automatically. (Launch Jan 4, 2024; Amazon partnership Mar 13, 2024). ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-launches-end-end-digital-healthcare-experience-through/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [aboutamazon.com](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-pharmacy-diabetes-migraine-medication-lillydirect?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Beneficiary support functions publicly described: partners handle prior‑authorizations/benefits verification and claims processing (vendor descriptions/news coverage). No Lilly public statement (through Aug 7, 2025) provided enrollment counts or Medicaid‑specific billing commitments. ([biospace.com](https://www.biospace.com/business/lilly-pfizer-take-meds-straight-to-consumers-in-renewed-dtc-push?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/lilly-partners-with-amazon-deliver-zepbound-other-drugs-2024-03-13/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Low‑digital access (phone enrollment, explicit multilingual enrollment workflows, or community‑pharmacy pickup) were not detailed in Lilly’s public LillyDirect announcements; Lilly does list general patient support contacts and has broader Spanish resources historically, but LillyDirect has not published specific phone‑enrollment or Medicaid‑billing metrics. ([lilly.com](https://www.lilly.com/contact-us?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-better-healthtm-expands-website-include-spanish-health?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you’d like, I can pull direct page excerpts or search state Medicaid rulings/plan coverage for Lilly drugs.

[175] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly publicly released patient‑reported outcomes (PROs) from pivotal orforglipron clinical trials or early launch real‑world data, and has the company disclosed primary‑care versus specialist initiation rates for orforglipron; if so, what PRO instruments, scores, and initiation percentages (with data sources and sample sizes) were reported? A: Short answer: No — as of Aug 7, 2025 Eli Lilly has not publicly reported patient‑reported outcome (PRO) scores/instruments from its pivotal orforglipron programs nor released early‑launch real‑world data or provider‑initiation splits (primary‑care vs specialist). What I checked (representative public sources): - ACHIEVE‑1 (type‑2 diabetes): NEJM paper (published ahead‑of‑print June 21, 2025) reports efficacy/safety and N=559, but the article/abstract and online supplement index do not present PRO instruments or PRO scores. ([ovid.com](https://www.ovid.com/journals/nejm/fulltext/10.1056/nejmoa2505669~orforglipron-an-oral-small-molecule-glp-1-receptor-agonist)) - ATTAIN‑1 (weight management): Lilly press release (Aug 7, 2025) reports pivotal topline efficacy/safety and N=3,127 but does not report PRO instruments/scores or any real‑world initiation data; Lilly states regulatory submission planned but no commercial launch/RWD at that date. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-delivers-weight-loss-average-273?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Transparency: absence of PROs or initiation‑rate figures in these public releases does not prove they were never collected; Lilly may report PROs in full publications, conference slides, ClinicalTrials.gov entries or later regulatory filings. If you want, I can (a) scan the NEJM supplementary appendix and conference posters for PRO tables, and (b) search regulatory (FDA/EMA) filings as they become available.

[176] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly publicly announced plans to run a controlled real‑world pilot or randomized study pairing orforglipron with a certified digital therapeutic (for example, AI‑guided titration plus remote coaching) versus Lilly Direct alone; if so, what study design details were disclosed (sample size, randomization, primary endpoints, follow-up duration, and planned analysis timelines)? A: Short answer: No — I found no public announcement by Eli Lilly, as of Aug 7, 2025, that it plans a controlled real‑world pilot or randomized study specifically pairing orforglipron with a certified digital therapeutic (e.g., AI‑guided titration + remote coaching) vs. LillyDirect alone. I searched Lilly press releases, LillyDirect/partner announcements and clinical‑trial registries and found orforglipron Phase‑3 results and digital‑health partnerships (LillyDirect, Thrive Global) but no published study protocol or design details matching your description. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-delivers-weight-loss-average-273?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/thrive-global-works-with-eli-lilly-and-company-to-offer-healthy-behaviors-tools-and-resources-to-improve-health-outcomes-302346463.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [ichgcp.net](https://ichgcp.net/clinical-trials-registry/NCT05869903?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can (a) set up a live search/watch for any new announcement, or (b) run a deeper search (press, SEC filings, clinicaltrials.gov) and return any subsequent disclosures.

[177] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, what prescription‑volume disclosures has Eli Lilly published for Lilly Direct (for example, the reported ≈1.1 million Q2 prescriptions), and has Lilly publicly released any pre‑specified real‑world evidence (RWE) analysis plans or dashboards for comparative effectiveness analyses of orforglipron versus injectable incretins; if such RWE plans/dashboards exist, where are they posted and what are the pre‑specified endpoints and timelines? A: Short answer — (1) Lilly publicly disclosed LillyDirect prescription volumes in its Q2 2025 results/earnings call: management said LillyDirect recorded about 1.1 million total TRx in Q2 and said cash‑pay vials were ~20% of U.S. Zepbound prescriptions and >35% of new Zepbound prescriptions in Q2. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-second-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-raises?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [insidermonkey.com](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/eli-lilly-and-company-nyselly-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript-1586484?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) (2) I found no publicly posted, pre‑specified RWE analysis plan or public RWE dashboard comparing orforglipron to injectable incretins as of Aug 7, 2025 on Lilly’s investor/medical sites, ClinicalTrials.gov or major RWE registries — Lilly’s public postings list randomized trials for orforglipron but not any pre‑specified observational RWE protocols/dashboards. (If you want, I can re-check specific registries/OSF/ENCePP or file a targeted FOIA/registry search.) ([lilly.com](https://www.lilly.com/clinical-research/clinical-trials?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [medical.lilly.com](https://medical.lilly.com/us/products/answers/what-orforglipron-clinical-trials-are-being-conducted-in-people-with-type-2-diabetes-229911?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

<a id="post-178"></a>
[178] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly publicly disclosed estimates of how increasing sellable‑dose capacity for incretins to ~1.8× will affect per‑dose manufacturing costs or enable list‑price concessions; if such cost or pricing guidance was provided, what per‑dose cost reductions or list‑price concession ranges were disclosed and what assumptions underlie those estimates? A: Short answer: No — Lilly has publicly stated plans to raise salable‑dose capacity (management cited ~1.6× for H1‑2025 and “at least 1.8×” for H2‑2025 on the Q2 call) and has announced lower list‑price vial options, but it has not published an explicit per‑dose manufacturing‑cost reduction number tied to the ~1.8× capacity increase. Lilly has disclosed list‑price concessions for vial presentations (≥50% off competitors’ list prices initially; later rollout of many vial strengths at $499/month or less) and company‑level guidance that net prices may decline mid‑to‑high single digits — but no per‑dose cost or specific cost‑savings range or detailed cost assumptions were quantified.

[179] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What merger notification filings related to Verve Therapeutics and SiteOne has Eli Lilly publicly filed (for example, HSR filing dates) and, as of August 7, 2025, have any competition authorities (U.S. FTC, DOJ, European Commission, or other national regulators) publicly opened reviews, issued complaints, or imposed remedies related to Eli Lilly’s acquisitions of Verve or SiteOne; if so, provide the authority, action, and date? A: Short answer (as of Aug 7, 2025): - Verve Therapeutics — Lilly and Verve filed HSR pre‑merger notifications on June 25, 2025; the FTC granted early termination of the HSR waiting period on July 22, 2025. No public FTC/DOJ/EC complaint, second‑request, or remedies were posted through Aug 7, 2025. ([vervetx.gcs-web.com](https://vervetx.gcs-web.com/node/9121/html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [ftc.gov](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/early-termination-notices?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - SiteOne Therapeutics — Lilly announced the deal on May 27, 2025. I found no public company/agency disclosure of an HSR filing or any FTC/DOJ/European or national competition authority review, complaint, or imposed remedy posted by Aug 7, 2025 (Lilly’s Q2 release on Aug 7 noted the SiteOne acquisition as completed). This absence is based on public agency sites and Lilly/SiteOne disclosures; it does not prove no filings exist confidentially. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-expand-its-pain-pipeline-acquisition-siteone-therapeutics?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947825000202/q225lillysalesandearningsp.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can run a deeper agency‑registry search (DOJ/EC/national authorities) and return any later updates.

[180] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly publicly committed to presenting results from the SURPASS‑CVOT and the ATTAIN/ACHIEVE programs at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) 2025 meeting, and has the company announced intended peer‑review publication plans or the initiation of additional Phase III or post‑approval trials (for maintenance, hypertension, osteoarthritis knee, or other indications); if so, what are the stated timelines and trial identifiers? A: Short answer: Yes. - Eli Lilly’s July 31, 2025 SURPASS‑CVOT topline release states detailed SURPASS‑CVOT results will be presented at EASD 2025 (September) and “subsequently published in a peer‑reviewed journal”; trial = SURPASS‑CVOT (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04255433). ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-mounjaro-tirzepatide-gipglp-1-dual-agonist-demonstrated?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Lilly’s Aug 7, 2025 ATTAIN press release says detailed ATTAIN‑1 results will be presented at EASD 2025 (Sept.) and published in a peer‑reviewed journal; ATTAIN‑1 = NCT05869903; ACHIEVE‑1 (diabetes program) = NCT05971940 (published June 2025). Lilly also states plans for regulatory submissions by year‑end 2025.

[181] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, have any APAC national payers or health systems publicly included orforglipron or other oral obesity medicines on national formularies or tenders; if so, which countries made decisions, what were the reimbursement or tender outcomes, and what implementation timelines were announced? A: Short answer: No. As of Aug 7, 2025 there are no public APAC national-payer or national‑formulary/tender listings for orforglipron or any oral GLP‑1 obesity pill. Evidence/examples: - New Zealand’s Pharmac explicitly states semaglutide (Wegovy) is not funded and no funding application has been received. ([pharmac.govt.nz](https://www.pharmac.govt.nz/news-and-resources/news/semaglutide-wegovy-ozempic?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Australia’s PBAC/PBS has not recommended semaglutide (Wegovy) for obesity (Wegovy listing shown as “Not recommended”). ([pbs.gov.au](https://www.pbs.gov.au/medicinestatus/document/1057.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Oral candidates (e.g., Lilly’s orforglipron, Novo’s oral semaglutide) were in late‑stage development/regulatory review in 2025 but had not reached APAC national formulary/tender listing by that date. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/drugmakers-racing-launch-first-weight-loss-pill-2025-08-07/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can check specific APAC payers (Japan, China, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia) for any subsequent announcements.

### Round 3

<a id="post-182"></a>
[182] **Healthcare Payer Analyst** [Strength] Payer leverage opportunity: orforglipron’s oral route plus LillyDirect scale (≈1.1M Q2 TRx) enables payers to design oral‑first step therapy with mandated, time‑bound RWE collection (adherence, weight, A1c, AE‑driven discontinuation) to lower net spend while preserving outcomes. [Status: UNKNOWN real‑world oral vs injectable adherence; Status: INCONCLUSIVE long‑term CV outcomes for orforglipron] | Falsifier: head‑to‑head RWE shows equal adherence {Conf: Med} _(🔄 3)_

<a id="post-183"></a>
[183] **Venture Partner, Biotech Funds** [Strength] Lilly’s Q2 M&A and pipeline moves materially hedge commercial concentration: Verve’s one‑time genetic therapies + SiteOne’s non‑opioid pain asset, alongside expanded oncology/neuro launches and Lilly Direct + scaled manufacturing, create diversified reimbursement models (one‑time, procedure‑like payments vs chronic scripts), reducing EPS sensitivity to payer pressure on incretins and enabling segmented global pricing/outcomes optionality [Status: INCONCLUSIVE on timing of payer uptake] | Falsifier: incretins >80% revenue next year {Conf: Med} _(🔄 1)_

<a id="post-184"></a>
[184] **Chief Technology Officer, HealthTech Startup** [Strength] Recommend Lilly publish a payer‑grade LillyDirect minimal dataset (FHIR profile), a public interoperability spec, and a pre‑specified RWE analysis plan (12‑month persistence, AE‑related discontinuation, weight/metabolic endpoints) to de‑risk payer decisions and accelerate formulary access [Status: UNKNOWN whether Lilly will publish; Status: PROPRIETARY: current data holdings] | Falsifier: publish FHIR dataset + SAP publicly {Conf: Med} _(🔄 14)_

<a id="post-185"></a>
[185] **Bioethicist** [Strength] Lilly Direct’s scale can be leveraged to close ethical and payer gaps—recommend Lilly publish a pre‑specified RWD analysis plan (explicit estimand, missing‑data rules, timelines) that embeds equity endpoints (race/ethnicity, SES proxies, comorbidity), and release standardized informed‑consent/data‑sharing disclosures for telehealth/cash‑pay patients; transparent, equity‑focused RWE and consent will reduce access/coverage friction and build trust with payers/regulators. [Status: UNKNOWN] | Falsifier: publish pre‑specified RWD equity plan {Conf: Med} _(🔄 13)_

<a id="post-186"></a>
[186] **Global Supply Chain Specialist** [Risk] Lilly’s 1.8× sellable‑dose ramp risks execution delays because greenfield commissioning needs time‑consuming tech‑transfer, site qualification, supplier re‑qualification and FDA/EMA inspections — causing month‑to‑quarter lags before validated commercial batches relieve tight supply [Status: UNKNOWN: inspection/batch‑release timelines]. | Falsifier: publish FDA/EMA inspection and batch‑release dates {Conf: Med} _(🔄 7)_

<a id="post-187"></a>
[187] **Patient Advocate (Obesity & Diabetes)** [Strength] Partnering with patient advocacy/community groups to co‑design culturally tailored education, peer‑mentoring, and adherence supports—deployed via Lilly Direct—could materially raise equitable initiation and 12‑month persistence because trust and tailored care reduce stigma and barriers [Status: UNKNOWN]. | Falsifier: publish partnership MOUs {Conf: Med} _(🔄 5)_

<a id="post-188"></a>
[188] **Actuary, Life/Reinsurance** [Strength] Lilly’s SURPASS CVOT signal plus disclosed production and LillyDirect metrics create an actionable dataset for insurers/reinsurers to convert clinical signals into quantifiable reserving and product design inputs—recommend immediate cohort microsimulations (stratified by BMI/comorbidity, uptake/persistence scenarios, and treatment effects on all‑cause mortality/MACE) to estimate annuity/reserve sensitivity (e.g., PV change per 100k treated) and to structure value‑based reinsurance/underwriting adjustments. [Status: INCONCLUSIVE: real‑world effect magnitude and uptake uncertain] | Falsifier: publish insurer mortality-table changes {Conf: Med} _(🔄 5)_

<a id="post-189"></a>
[189] **Health Policy Strategist** [Strength] Lilly can defuse policy/regulatory risk and accelerate payer access by offering a time‑limited, multi‑country "on‑ramp" pricing pilot — e.g., commit to narrower US‑EU list‑price gaps for new launches for 3 years in exchange for expedited reimbursement and publish a LillyDirect transparency dashboard (net vs list, payer mix, patient demographics) to demonstrate value and reduce calls for mandatory parity. [Status: INCONCLUSIVE] | Falsifier: publish signed parity/on‑ramp pilot {Conf: Med}

<a id="post-190"></a>
[190] **Institutional Pharma Sales Rep** [Strength] Orforglipron's once‑daily oral format reduces concrete hospital operational frictions (no cold‑chain, no clinic inject scheduling, less nursing/admin time), making it feasible to start therapy at discharge, via embedded PCP standing‑orders, or through outpatient pharmacy dispensing—operational levers that should speed real‑world initiation versus injectables [Status: INCONCLUSIVE]. Recommend piloting discharge‑to‑outpatient workflows with care‑manager enrollment to bridge coverage. | Falsifier: hospital discharge Rx starts unchanged {Conf: Med}

→ [View related research](#post-207)

<a id="post-191"></a>
[191] **Science Communications Educator** [Strength] Ask Lilly to publish a concise "trial‑statistics dashboard" for ATTAIN/ACHIEVE listing: primary estimand(s); full SAP or missing‑data methods (MMRM/MI/treatment‑policy); ITT and treatment‑regimen estimates side‑by‑side; on‑treatment/completer results; timing/reasons for discontinuation; subgroup Ns/effect estimates; pre‑specified sensitivity/tipping‑point analyses; AE timing/adjudication and per‑protocol definition—because these items let investors and clinicians judge bias, informative missingness and heterogeneity [Status: UNKNOWN] | Falsifier: publish SAP and sensitivity tables {Conf: High} _(🔄 20)_

A: Yes. Eli Lilly has publicly posted a corporate sustainability and supply‑chain governance framework: the document is titled "2024 Sustainability Report" (which includes a dedicated "Supply Chain Management" / governance section). The report’s publication date is June 6, 2025, and it is publicly available on Lilly’s sustainability site (report landing page and downloadable PDF).

[207] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, have any major U.S. hospital systems or integrated delivery networks publicly reported measured changes in the percentage of inpatient discharges followed by initiation of incretin therapy comparing oral orforglipron versus injectable incretins; if so, which systems reported such data and what were the reported initiation‑rate changes (percentage points and relevant date ranges)? A: Short answer: No. As of August 7, 2025 I found no major U.S. hospital system or integrated delivery network that has publicly reported measured changes in the percent of inpatient discharges followed by initiation comparing oral orforglipron vs injectable incretins. Orforglipron is still investigational/not commercially available (Lilly planned regulatory submissions later in 2025), so health systems could not report real-world inpatient‑discharge initiation comparisons.

[208] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: Does the New England Journal of Medicine publication of Eli Lilly’s ACHIEVE‑1 trial include a prespecified primary estimand and the planned missing‑data handling methods in its online supplement; if so, what is the prespecified primary estimand and which missing‑data method(s) (for example, MMRM, multiple imputation, treatment‑policy) were specified? A: Yes. NEJM’s ACHIEVE‑1 materials (online Supplementary Appendix/statistical notes reported with the paper) prespecify an efficacy estimand as the primary efficacy perspective and describe planned missing‑data methods: MMRM for the efficacy (continuous longitudinal) analyses, and multiple‑imputation (pattern‑mixture/ANCOVA style imputation with results combined by Rubin’s rules) for the treatment‑regimen/treatment‑policy style analyses and binary endpoints. See the NEJM article record and Lilly’s ACHIEVE‑1 methods/figure footnotes.

[209] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: Have state environmental permit applications or public notices been filed and made publicly available for Eli Lilly’s Research Triangle Park expansion and the company’s planned U.S. incretin manufacturing plants as of August 7, 2025; if so, what are the filing dates and which key permit parameters were disclosed (for example, proposed water allocations, air emission limits, wastewater discharge limits, or hazardous‑waste permit details), and where can those filings be accessed? A: Short answer: Yes. - Research Triangle Park (RTP): NCDEQ published a draft NPDES public notice for Eli Lilly’s RTP facility (permit NC0089974) — public comment opened Oct 14, 2021 (comment period closed Nov 15, 2021). Notice/disclaimer lists the discharge (cooling water) to an unnamed tributary of Northeast Creek and gives outfall coordinates (the draft permit was posted on NCDEQ’s eDocs). ([deq.nc.gov](https://www.deq.nc.gov/news/events/public-comment-period-opens-ely-lilly-and-company-npdes-wastewater-permit-nc0089974)) - Planned U.S. incretin/API sites: Lilly’s 2025 site search produced public state filings. Example: a Texas JETI (tax/incentive) application posted May 2025 (signed May 2, 2025) for a proposed Generation Park/Houston API campus — it publicly discloses ~236 acres, planned wastewater treatment infrastructure, maps, estimated $≈5.9B investment and ~604 jobs. Separate Indiana DEQ/IDEM public notices (Lebanon/LEAP) show NPDES/air‑permit public notices and draft air‑permit comment periods in 2024–2025 (permit numbers and draft permits available on IDEM’s public‑notice pages).

[210] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly or any named collaborator publicly announced an FDA‑cleared plasma p‑tau or other blood‑based companion diagnostic intended for donanemab patient selection; if so, what is the diagnostic name, the FDA clearance or authorization date, and has a corresponding CPT code or national reimbursement decision been published (provide code/decision and date)? A: Short answer: No. As of Aug 7, 2025, Eli Lilly or its named collaborators had not publicly announced an FDA‑cleared or FDA‑authorized plasma p‑tau or other blood‑based companion diagnostic specifically designated for selecting donanemab patients. Roche’s Elecsys pTau assays and Beckman’s pTau217/Abeta work have FDA Breakthrough Device designations (development stage), and C2N’s Precivity tests used in donanemab trials are CLIA LDTs (not FDA‑cleared). CPTs exist for clinical LDTs: PrecivityAD (C2N) is reported with CPT 0412U and PrecivityAD2 with 0503U; payers/policies currently treat many BBM assays variably (no broad CMS national coverage decision for a donanemab companion diagnostic as of that date).

A: Short answer: No. I found no public announcements (through 7 Aug 2025) by Asia‑Pacific national payers, health systems or procurement authorities that have listed or awarded tenders for orforglipron or any oral GLP‑1 product specifically for obesity. Orforglipron is still in late‑stage development with sponsor submissions planned later in 2025–2026, and oral semaglutide (oral Wegovy) was under regulatory review (FDA decision expected Q4‑2025) — i.e., regulatory decisions were still pending. Japan has reimbursed the injectable Wegovy (semaglutide) under NHI, but that is not an oral listing. ([lilly.com](https://www.lilly.com/news/stories/what-to-know-about-orforglipron?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [managedhealthcareexecutive.com](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/fda-sets-action-date-for-oral-wegovy-for-weight-loss?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [dom-pubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com](https://dom-pubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/dom.15638?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can run country‑by‑country checks (Australia PBAC/PBS, NZ PHARMAC, Korea HIRA, China NRDL, Singapore MOH/Tenders) and return any newly posted decisions.

[235] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly publicly posted a concise investor‑facing trial interpretation one‑pager or brief (covering primary estimand(s), prespecified missing‑data methods, ITT vs treatment‑regimen estimates, AE adjudication timing, discontinuation Ns, key subgroup effect sizes, and planned RWE/LillyDirect analyses); if such a document exists, what is its title, publication date, and where can it be accessed? A: Short answer: No — there is no single, concise “investor‑facing trial interpretation one‑pager” posted by Eli Lilly on Aug 7, 2025 that contains all of the technical items you listed in one brief. What Lilly did post (and where) - Press release (investor site): "Lilly’s oral GLP‑1, orforglipron, delivers weight loss of up to an average of 27.3 lbs in first of two pivotal Phase 3 trials in adults with obesity" — Aug 7, 2025. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-delivers-weight-loss-average-273?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Medical/FAQ summary: "In ATTAIN‑1, how did orforglipron compare with placebo…" (Lilly Medical; last review Aug 5, 2025) — includes efficacy vs treatment‑regimen and efficacy estimands, AE rates and discontinuation percentages but not full prespecified missing‑data methods, AE adjudication timing, absolute discontinuation Ns, detailed subgroup effect sizes or planned RWE/LillyDirect analysis plans. ([medical.lilly.com](https://medical.lilly.com/us/products/answers/in-attain-1-how-did-orforglipron-compare-with-placebo-in-adults-with-obesity-or-overweight-with-weight-related-comorbidities-288608)) Note: Lilly says full ATTAIN‑1 details will be presented at EASD and in subsequent publications; for deeper prespecified‑methods details check the forthcoming EASD slides / full paper when posted.

[236] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, have any securities‑class action lawsuits, SEC investigations, or other formal regulatory enforcement matters been publicly filed or announced against Eli Lilly that specifically reference disclosures about orforglipron efficacy, safety, or forward‑looking guidance; if so, what are the filing dates, courts or agencies, and brief descriptions of the claims? A: Short answer: No. I found no publicly filed securities‑class actions, SEC investigations, or other formal regulatory enforcement matters as of August 7, 2025 that specifically reference orforglipron-related disclosures (efficacy, safety, or forward‑looking guidance). Major coverage of Lilly’s Aug 7, 2025 orforglipron announcement and Lilly’s own investor release are available, and Lilly’s SEC filings list ongoing litigation/MDLs (including GLP‑1 product‑liability MDL) but do not show any orforglipron‑specific securities or enforcement filings as of that date. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-delivers-weight-loss-average-273?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947825000132/lly-20250331.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [classaction.org](https://www.classaction.org/news/lawsuits-claim-novo-nordisk-eli-lilly-failed-to-properly-disclose-debilitating-side-effects-of-glp-1-weight-loss-drugs?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you’d like, I can (a) run a PACER/court‑docket search for filings dated Aug 7–9, 2025, or (b) monitor for any post‑Aug‑7 securities filings that cite orforglipron.

[237] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly publicly adopted board‑approved, executive‑compensation‑linked ESG KPIs tied to incretin production or LillyDirect access targets (for example, a commitment to publish a dose‑level life‑cycle assessment within 12 months or a LillyDirect Medicaid/low‑income TRx share target such as ≥15%); if so, what are the KPIs, targets, and effective dates? A: Short answer: No public, board‑approved executive‑compensation KPIs specifically tied to incretin production or LillyDirect access targets (e.g., a commitment to publish dose‑level LCAs within 12 months or a LillyDirect Medicaid/low‑income TRx ≥15%) were disclosed as of August 7, 2025. What I checked: Lilly’s 2025 proxy/compensation disclosures note sustainability expectations can influence pay but do not publish specific, board‑approved ESG KPIs or numeric LillyDirect access/TRx targets; Lilly’s 2024 Sustainability Report lists product‑stewardship and value‑chain reporting goals but contains no dose‑level LCA commitment or LillyDirect Medicaid/TRx share target. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000059478/000005947825000107/lly-20250321.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [sustainability.lilly.com](https://sustainability.lilly.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-launches-end-end-digital-healthcare-experience-through/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can (1) search more widely for corporate presentations/earnings Q&As or state filings through Aug 7, 2025, or (2) monitor future filings for any announced KPI/compensation link.

[238] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, had Eli Lilly publicly announced any time‑limited, indication‑specific rebate or outcomes‑based contracting programs for orforglipron that tie reimbursement to 6‑month persistence or weight‑loss thresholds and cap per‑patient spend; if so, which payers or purchasers are involved and what are the specific program thresholds and financial mechanics disclosed? A: Short answer: No. As of Aug 7, 2025 I found no public Eli Lilly announcement describing a time‑limited, indication‑specific rebate or outcomes‑based program for orforglipron that ties reimbursement to 6‑month persistence or specific weight‑loss thresholds with a capped per‑patient spend. Lilly’s public orforglipron materials/press releases make no such disclosure, and payer/PBM public programs announced in 2024–2025 (e.g., Evernorth/Express Scripts caps and guarantees) reference existing branded GLP‑1s (Zepbound, Wegovy) — not orforglipron. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-showed-compelling-efficacy-and?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/evernorth-launches-new-benefit-option-that-drives-lower-net-cost-for-weight-loss-medicines-and-limits-patient-cost-to-no-more-than-200-per-month-302462363.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/lillys-glp-1-pill-cuts-body-weight-by-124-trial-lagging-novos-injection-2025-08-07/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Note: absence of a public announcement in these sources is not proof that private, non‑public contracts don’t exist; I can run a deeper search of PBM press releases, state purchaser notices or procurement filings if you’d like.

<a id="post-239"></a>
[239] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, have any insurers, reinsurers, or major payers publicly published microsimulation or actuarial analyses that map SURPASS‑CVOT hazard ratios and ATTAIN metabolic effects into BMI‑stratified, age‑specific mortality or reserve‑impact estimates; if so, which organizations published them and what were the principal quantitative results (for example, projected PV change per 100,000 treated or reserve sensitivity bands)? A: Short answer: No. I could not find any publicly posted insurer/reinsurer/major‑payer microsimulation or actuarial report (as of 7 Aug 2025) that explicitly maps SURPASS‑CVOT hazard ratios and ATTAIN metabolic effects into BMI‑stratified, age‑specific mortality or reserve‑impact outputs (e.g., PV change per 100,000 or reserve‑sensitivity bands). Large reinsurers published high‑level impact notes (Munich Re’s “Obesity” Life Science chapter with headline mortality‑reduction scenarios), and academic teams published microsimulations of GLP‑1 coverage for Medicare, but none published the precise SURPASS‑CVOT+ATTAIN → BMI×age → reserve PV mappings you described. ([munichre.com](https://www.munichre.com/landingpage/en/life-science-report-2025/obesity.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12032556/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can (a) run a targeted follow‑up search for any reports issued Aug 8–today, or (b) build a reproducible microsimulation that applies SURPASS‑CVOT/ATTAIN inputs to generate the BMI‑ and age‑specific reserve estimates you want.

[240] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, have any major U.S. pharmacy benefit managers or payers (for example, CVS Caremark, Cigna/Express Scripts, or UnitedHealthcare) publicly announced time‑limited coverage policies for orforglipron conditioned on 12‑month real‑world evidence thresholds (for example, ≥60% persistence, ≥10% placebo‑adjusted weight loss, or ≥1% A1c improvement in type 2 diabetes); if so, which organizations announced such policies and what exact thresholds and enforcement mechanisms were disclosed? A: Short answer — No. As of August 7, 2025 there are no public announcements from major U.S. PBMs/payers (e.g., CVS Caremark, Cigna/Express Scripts, UnitedHealthcare/Optum) that put orforglipron on a time‑limited coverage policy explicitly conditioned on 12‑month RWE thresholds such as ≥60% persistence, ≥10% placebo‑adjusted weight loss, or ≥1% A1c improvement. Major payers have issued class-level management updates (prior‑authorizations, formulary preferences or exclusions for GLP‑1s) but I found no payer press release or formulary policy text that specifies those exact 12‑month RWE thresholds or an enforcement mechanism for orforglipron. ([prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/novo-nordisk-announces-that-cvs-caremark-the-countrys-largest-pbm-has-decided-wegovy-will-be-the-preferred-glp-1-medicine-covered-for-obesity-on-its-template-formularies-302443603.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [uhcprovider.com](https://www.uhcprovider.com/en/resource-library/news/2023/prior-auth-glucagon-like-peptide-1-medications.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [optum.com](https://www.optum.com/en/business/insights/advisory-services/page.hub5.preparing-plan-for-glp-1-era.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you’d like, I can (a) run targeted searches of payer formularies/medical policy pages and P&T minutes dated through Aug 7, 2025, or (b) monitor for any new conditional/RWE coverage announcements.

[241] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, what trial protocol or statistical‑analysis‑plan details has Eli Lilly publicly posted for the ATTAIN‑1 orforglipron study regarding hepatic‑safety monitoring cadence, Hy's Law criteria, the presence and charter of any blinded hepatic‑adjudication committee, and post‑treatment hepatic follow‑up duration? A: Short answer (as of Aug 7, 2025): I could not find any publicly posted ATTAIN‑1 protocol or SAP from Eli Lilly that specifies the liver‑safety monitoring cadence, the exact Hy’s‑Law thresholds as implemented, a blinded hepatic‑(DILI) adjudication‑committee charter, or the scheduled post‑treatment hepatic follow‑up duration. Lilly’s public materials (press release/FAQ) and the trial registry (NCT05869903) report summary safety outcomes (“no hepatic safety signal observed”) but do not include the protocol/SAP or committee charter text. Phase‑1/2 papers likewise report no liver signal but do not publish ATTAIN‑1 monitoring details. If you want, I can (a) check the EASD 2025 presentation/supplement (upcoming detailed data) or (b) search regulatory filings (FDA/EMA briefing/appendix) for protocol/SAP text.

[242] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly publicly announced the initiation, protocol, or results of a payer‑focused randomized pragmatic Lilly Direct pilot (for example, the proposed ~2,400‑person employer randomized study comparing embedded digital therapeutic plus proactive management versus standard Lilly Direct); if so, what are the disclosed study design details (sample size, arms, primary endpoints, follow‑up duration) and any interim or final outcomes? A: Short answer: No public announcement located. I could not find any Eli Lilly press release, SEC filing, clinical‑trial registry entry, or major news report (through Aug 7, 2025) that (a) initiates, (b) posts the protocol for, or (c) reports interim/final results from a payer‑focused randomized pragmatic “Lilly Direct” pilot (for example the ~2,400‑person employer RCT you describe). Lilly has publicly described and expanded LillyDirect (launch and later Alzheimer/other expansions) and mentioned LillyDirect in its Q2‑2025 results, but I found no public trial registration or protocol details for a payer/employer RCT. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-launches-end-end-digital-healthcare-experience-through/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can run targeted searches of ClinicalTrials.gov, conference abstracts, SEC filings and trade press to double‑check for any registry entries or grey‑literature mentions.

[243] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly publicly posted the ATTAIN‑1 statistical analysis plan (SAP) or equivalent documentation that specifies the trial’s prespecified primary estimand and the planned missing‑data handling methods (for example, mixed‑model repeated measures, multiple imputation, treatment‑policy/efficacy estimand); if so, what is the primary estimand and which missing‑data methods were specified? A: Short answer — As of Aug 7, 2025 Eli Lilly has publicly reported ATTAIN‑1’s prespecified primary estimand (the “efficacy” estimand; a treatment‑regimen estimand was also pre‑specified), but I could not find a publicly posted full ATTAIN‑1 statistical analysis plan (SAP) or protocol document that details the planned missing‑data handling methods. The company’s press release and medical Q&A state the primary estimand is the efficacy estimand but do not specify the missing‑data algorithm (MMRM, MI, treatment‑policy, etc.) publicly.

[245] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, have any publicly disclosed payer contracts or pilot agreements been announced that bundle oral incretin therapies, injectable incretin therapies, and gene‑therapy assets (for example, programs from Verve or SiteOne) under a single value‑over‑time pricing arrangement; if so, which payers and manufacturers are parties and what are the contract terms or pilot designs? A: Short answer: No. I found no publicly disclosed payer contract or pilot (as of Aug 7, 2025) that bundles oral incretin therapies + injectable incretin therapies + any gene‑therapy asset (e.g., Verve programs) into a single value‑over‑time pricing arrangement. What I checked: CMS’s Cell & Gene Therapy (CGT) Access Model and multiple industry reports on outcomes/value‑based contracts — which document gene‑therapy OBAs and separate payer discussions/pilots for GLP‑1s, but not a combined portfolio contract covering oral + injectable incretins plus a gene therapy. ([cms.gov](https://www.cms.gov/cgt-access-model-frequently-asked-questions?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [managedhealthcareexecutive.com](https://www.managedhealthcareexecutive.com/view/can-outcomes-based-agreements-work-for-weight-loss-drugs-?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Note: this is based on publicly available disclosures; if you want, I can run a focused search of press releases or SEC/plan filings for specific payers or manufacturers (e.g., Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Verve, Fractyl) to double‑check any smaller or non‑press releases.

[246] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly publicly announced any formal partnerships or pilot agreements with federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) or 340B clinics to enable in‑clinic initiation of orforglipron that include Medicaid billing processes, community health‑worker enrollment support, or multilingual navigation; if so, which clinics or networks and what operational capabilities/timelines were disclosed? A: Short answer: I found no public announcement by Eli Lilly (through its press releases, orforglipron FAQ, or major news coverage) as of Aug 7, 2025, of any formal partnerships or pilot agreements with FQHCs or 340B clinics specifically to enable in‑clinic initiation of orforglipron that include Medicaid‑billing workflows, community‑health‑worker enrollment support, or multilingual navigation. Lilly has described orforglipron trial/launch plans and separately funds community CHW pilots (DIP‑IN) and has public 340B policies, but none of those public items name FQHC/340B pilots for orforglipron with the operational capabilities/timelines you asked about.

[247] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly publicly disclosed the percentage split of its incretin manufacturing capacity that is non‑sterile (oral/solid dose) versus sterile (injectable) and any published regional metrics such as 'time‑to‑first‑release' by facility or region for incretin products; if so, what are the reported percentages and time metrics and where are those disclosures posted? A: Short answer: No. I could not find any Eli Lilly public disclosure that gives an explicit percentage split of incretin manufacturing capacity (non‑sterile/oral/solid‑dose vs sterile/injectable) or published “time‑to‑first‑release” metrics by facility or region as of Aug 7, 2025. Lilly’s SEC filings, investor releases and manufacturing pages describe capacity expansions and high‑level production targets (e.g., producing ~1.6× salable incretin doses in H1 2025) but do not report facility‑level splits or time‑to‑release KPIs. See Lilly’s SEC filings and investor/manufacturing pages for the company’s public manufacturing commentary.

[248] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, which state or federal environmental permit applications or public notices related to Eli Lilly’s Research Triangle Park expansion and planned U.S. incretin manufacturing plants had been filed and made publicly available (for example, NCDEQ NPDES NC0089974 or Texas JETI Houston filings); for each filing provide the filing date and the key permit parameters disclosed such as proposed water allocations, air emission limits (VOC tons/yr), wastewater discharge limits, or hazardous‑waste thresholds and where the documents can be accessed? A: Short answer — three publicly posted filings (state or state-hosted) were available by Aug 7, 2025: - NCDEQ public notice — draft NPDES (NC0089974) for Eli Lilly, Research Triangle Park: public notice posted Oct 14, 2021; describes a cooling‑water discharge to an unnamed tributary of Northeast Creek and states “no parameters are water‑quality limited” (draft permit available from NCDEQ edocs). ([deq.nc.gov](https://www.deq.nc.gov/news/events/public-comment-period-opens-ely-lilly-and-company-npdes-wastewater-permit-nc0089974)) - NCDEQ public notice — draft NPDES modification (NC0090239) for Lilly, Concord: public notice posted Apr 19, 2024; describes cooling‑water outfalls to tributaries of Coddle Creek and notes some parameters are water‑quality limited (draft/modification documents at NCDEQ).

[249] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, have any major U.S. hospital systems or integrated delivery networks publicly announced implementation plans for inpatient‑to‑outpatient discharge workflows to initiate orforglipron (for example, P&T addenda, EMR discharge order templates, outpatient pharmacy stocking or first‑fill assistance, or 340B use), and if so which systems and what implementation timelines or coverage conditions were disclosed? A: Short answer: No clear public announcements were found. As of Aug 7, 2025, I could not find any major U.S. health system or IDN (e.g., Kaiser, Cleveland Clinic, Ascension, HCA, CommonSpirit, Mayo) that has publicly posted P&T addenda, EMR discharge‑order templates, outpatient‑pharmacy stocking/first‑fill programs, or explicit 340B plans specifically for initiating orforglipron at discharge. Lilly announced pivotal results and said it plans regulatory submissions later in 2025, i.e., the drug is not yet an approved, on‑market product. That likely explains the absence of system‑level rollout notices. I may have missed internal/committee communications; absence of public notice is not proof none exist. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-delivers-weight-loss-average-273?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [beckershospitalreview.com](https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/glp-1s/glp-1s-reshape-key-service-lines-what-to-know/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [hrsa.gov](https://www.hrsa.gov/about/faqs/can-340b-drugs-be-used-discharge-prescriptions?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can (a) run focused searches of specific systems’ P&T minutes or press rooms, or (b) monitor for announcements and report back.

[250] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, which specific indications for orforglipron (for example, obesity, hypertension, knee osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnea, type 2 diabetes maintenance) had active Phase III trials or regulatory approvals publicly listed by Eli Lilly or clinical trial registries, and what was the recruitment/enrollment status for each indication? A: Short answer (as of Aug 7, 2025): - Obesity / chronic weight management — Phase 3 ATTAIN program: ATTAIN‑1 announced topline results on Aug 7, 2025 (3,127 randomized; primary readout reported). ATTAIN‑2 (obesity + T2D) is listed as Phase‑3 “active, not recruiting” (est. ~1,500).

[251] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly or any named collaborator publicly announced an FDA‑cleared plasma p‑tau or other blood‑based companion diagnostic intended to support donanemab patient selection; if so what is the diagnostic name, the FDA clearance or authorization date, and has a corresponding CPT/HCPCS code or national reimbursement decision been published (please provide code/decision and date)? A: Short answer: No — as of Aug 7, 2025 Eli Lilly (or its named collaborator Roche) had not publicly announced an FDA‑cleared blood/plasma companion diagnostic specifically labeled or announced to support donanemab patient selection. Roche (a Lilly collaborator) had FDA Breakthrough designation for an Elecsys pTau217 assay but no FDA clearance by that date; Fujirebio’s Lumipulse G pTau217/β‑Amyloid 1‑42 Plasma Ratio was FDA‑cleared on May 16, 2025 (but is not a Lilly collaborator nor announced by Lilly as a donanemab companion diagnostic). CPT: new CPT chemistry codes for pTau/tTau (84393/84394) were added for 2025 (effective Jan 1, 2025) and labs are already using pTau CPTs. No CMS national coverage decision specifically authorizing plasma p‑tau tests for therapy selection had been published by Aug 7, 2025 (payer policies vary).

[252] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly publicly embedded psychosocial patient‑reported outcome instruments (for example PHQ‑9, GAD‑7, Body‑Image Scale, Weight‑Stigma items, WPAI, EQ‑5D) into ATTAIN or ACHIEVE trials or LillyDirect RWE with pre‑specified estimands and equity stratification, and if so what instruments, stratifications, and any public dashboard URLs or planned reporting timelines were disclosed? A: Short answer: Yes — but limited. Public trial registries for the ATTAIN/ACHIEVE programs list health‑related quality‑of‑life PROs (SF‑36v2 and the IWQOL‑Lite‑CT) as prespecified outcomes; Lilly’s public materials and press release(s) also report use of an “efficacy estimand” for primary analyses. I found no public prespecification in trial registrations or LillyDirect materials (through 7 Aug 2025) naming PHQ‑9, GAD‑7, Body‑Image scales, weight‑stigma items, WPAI, or EQ‑5D, nor any public LillyDirect RWE dashboards, equity‑stratified estimand plans, or dashboard URLs/timelines beyond statements that full ATTAIN/ACHIEVE results would be presented at upcoming scientific meetings and in peer‑reviewed publications.

[253] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly publicly released 6‑ and 12‑month patient‑reported outcomes (PROs) from pivotal orforglipron trials or early‑launch real‑world data, and if so what PRO instruments (for example EQ‑5D, PHQ‑9, GAD‑7), scores, sample sizes, and the reported results were disclosed and where are those data posted? A: Short answer: No. As of Aug 7, 2025, Eli Lilly’s public communications (NEJM publication of ACHIEVE‑1 and Lilly’s ATTAIN‑1 topline press release) do not include posted 6‑ or 12‑month patient‑reported‑outcome (PRO) tables (EQ‑5D, PHQ‑9, GAD‑7 or similar) with scores and sample sizes. Lilly’s ATTAIN‑1 detailed data were announced as topline on Aug 7, 2025 and detailed results were slated for forthcoming conference/journal release (EASD/peer review); the ACHIEVE‑1 NEJM paper/press materials similarly report clinical endpoints but do not publish 6‑ or 12‑month PRO score tables in the publicly available materials.

### Round 5

<a id="post-255"></a>
[255] **Healthcare Payer Analyst** [Strength] Propose an induction→maintenance pricing pathway: payers cover tirzepatide for a defined induction (e.g., 6 months) to achieve responder status, then orforglipron is reimbursed as a lower‑cost daily maintenance conditioned on objective responder thresholds (e.g., ≥10% weight loss at 6 months); this caps per‑patient budget, aligns clinical incentives, and creates a payer‑friendly route to broaden access.

[278] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly publicly implemented or reported on a hospital discharge‑to‑first‑fill pilot (for example, an EMR discharge order set plus outpatient pharmacy stocking/first‑fill and case‑manager outreach) that tracked eligible discharges started, time‑to‑first‑fill, and 30/90‑day persistence; if so, which hospital systems participated, what were the measured outcomes and timelines, and where are the results published? A: Short answer (as of August 7, 2025): I could not find any public Eli Lilly press release, peer‑reviewed paper, conference abstract, or ClinicalTrials.gov entry describing a hospital "discharge→first‑fill" pilot (EMR discharge order set + outpatient pharmacy stocking/first‑fill + case‑manager outreach) that reported the number of eligible discharges started, time‑to‑first‑fill, and 30/90‑day persistence. Lilly has published (and publicly described) related initiatives—e.g., LillyDirect (direct‑to‑patient pharmacy/telehealth) and in‑hospital initiation trials like EMPULSE (empagliflozin)—but those do not match the discharge‑to‑first‑fill pilot you describe. I did not find a published pilot with participating health systems, outcomes, timelines, or results.

[279] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly submitted country‑specific HTA dossiers or tender bids in Asia‑Pacific (APAC) markets for orforglipron or other oral obesity medicines, or has any APAC national payer/procurement authority awarded national formulary inclusion or tenders to orforglipron; if so, which countries submitted or awarded, what were the reimbursement or tender outcomes, and what implementation timelines were announced? A: Short answer — As of August 7, 2025 I found no public announcements or documents showing Eli Lilly has filed country‑specific HTA dossiers or tender bids in APAC for orforglipron, nor any APAC national payer/procurement award or national formulary listing for orforglipron. Lilly’s public statements (Aug 7, 2025) say it plans regulatory submissions “by year‑end 2025,” implying HTA/tender activity is not yet public. I also found no APAC HTA/tender awards for other oral obesity pills; (by contrast) Novo Nordisk has an active FDA filing for an oral semaglutide formulation (submitted May 2025). If you want, I can run a targeted check of specific APAC agencies (PBAC, PHARMAC, HIRA, NMPA, PMDA, Singapore MOH) for any later notices.

A: Short answer: I could not find any publicly posted, independent third‑party “equity audit” of LillyDirect as of August 7, 2025. My searches of Eli Lilly’s LillyDirect pages and news/SEC disclosures (including Lilly’s launch/press release and sustainability materials) show no published third‑party equity audit; major coverage of a July 2025 Senate probe into LillyDirect likewise does not cite a company‑published independent equity audit.

A: Short answer: No. I could not find any publicly posted management “stress‑test” tables from Eli Lilly that quantify revenue/EPS sensitivities for (A) enforced US–EU price parity, (B) Medicare negotiation/MFN caps, or (C) major PBM exclusions/generic substitution as of August 7, 2025. Lilly’s SEC filings and investor releases discuss these policy risks qualitatively (and note e.g. Jardiance selection under IRA) but do not publish management scenario tables with quantified revenue/EPS impacts. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947825000067/lly-20241231.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-reports-second-quarter-2025-financial-results-and-raises?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you’d like, I can (a) re-run a deeper search for any investor‑day slide decks or Q&A transcripts that might include numeric scenarios, or (b) compile third‑party analyst scenario models that do quantify such shocks.

[282] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly publicly committed to or launched a time‑bound low‑barrier access pilot for orforglipron with federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) or 340B clinics—characterized by a six‑month rollout across approximately 50 sites with phone enrollment, multilingual community‑health‑worker navigation, Medicaid billing/onsite first‑fill, and tracked six‑month persistence and AE‑related discontinuation metrics; if so, provide the pilot MOU, implementation dates, and reported enrollment or persistence metrics and where they were disclosed? A: Short answer: No public record was found as of Aug 7, 2025 showing Eli Lilly has publicly committed to or launched the specific time‑bound, low‑barrier FQHC/340B pilot you described (6‑month/≈50 sites with phone enrollment, multilingual CHW navigation, Medicaid billing/onsite first‑fill, tracked 6‑month persistence/AE discontinuation). Searches of Lilly press releases/FAQ pages and major coverage around the Aug 7, 2025 ATTAIN‑1/Orforglipron announcement show no MOU, implementation dates, or enrollment/persistence metrics matching that program. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-delivers-weight-loss-average-273?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [lilly.com](https://www.lilly.com/news/stories/what-to-know-about-orforglipron?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/lillys-glp-1-pill-cuts-body-weight-by-124-trial-lagging-novos-injection-2025-08-07/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Note: absence from public sources is not definitive proof no private pilot exists. I can (a) run deeper searches (partner/FQHC statements, HRSA/NACHC notices, state Medicaid communications), or (b) request Lilly’s public affairs contact for confirmation—which would you prefer?

[283] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly publicly disclosed an inland‑logistics contingency plan addressing risks to API inbound and finished‑dose outbound shipments (for example, container/railcar/truck shortages, rail‑crew constraints, hurricane‑season impacts) for its RTP/Indiana/Generation Park sites; if so, where is the contingency plan documented and what operational mitigations or timelines were specified? A: As of August 7, 2025 I could not find any publicly posted, site‑specific “inland‑logistics contingency plan” (covering container/railcar/truck shortages, rail‑crew constraints, hurricane‑season impacts) for Eli Lilly’s RTP, Lebanon/Indiana or proposed Generation Park sites. Lilly’s public filings describe broad supply‑chain risk management but do not publish a facility‑level transportation contingency plan. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947825000067/lly-20241231.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Local permitting/municipal materials for the Lebanon (Indiana) project do disclose road improvements, traffic‑management measures and construction timelines (and Generation Park remains a proposal under review), but these are project/permit mitigations rather than a formal public contingency plan. ([lpgrowsboone.com](https://www.lpgrowsboone.com/about-the-project/faqs/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [houstonchronicle.com](https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/real-estate/article/eli-lilly-houston-biomanufacturing-plant-pharma-20334978.php?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can search deeper (local permitting records, county/IDEA filings, or submit a records request) for any non‑public or narrowly posted documents.

[284] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, have any U.S. payers publicly adopted an induction‑then‑maintenance reimbursement pathway that reimburses tirzepatide for a defined induction period (for example, 6 months) and then reimburses orforglipron as a lower‑cost daily maintenance conditioned on an objective responder threshold (for example, ≥10% weight loss at 6 months); if so, which payers announced such policies and what exact induction length, responder thresholds, and reimbursement conditions were disclosed? A: Short answer: No. I found no public U.S. payer policy (as of Aug 7, 2025) that announces an “induction (tirzepatide) → defined‑length switch to orforglipron maintenance conditioned on a responder threshold” pathway. Orforglipron remained an investigational/phase‑3 product with Lilly planning regulatory submissions rather than any payer launch agreements, and existing payer policies that require responder thresholds (e.g., continued authorization after an initial period) do not specify switching to orforglipron. ([lilly.com](https://www.lilly.com/news/stories/what-to-know-about-orforglipron?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [aetna.com](https://www.aetna.com/products/rxnonmedicare/data/2024/Zepbound_PA_with_Limit_Policy_6192-C_UDR_11-2023_v2.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) What I checked: - Lilly statements: orforglipron was being readied for regulatory submission (not yet a marketed option payers could name). ([lilly.com](https://www.lilly.com/news/stories/what-to-know-about-orforglipron?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Example payer policy (Aetna) shows standard induction/reauthorization rules (e.g., initial approval windows and a ≥5% weight‑loss continuation threshold) but does not commit to an induction→orforglipron maintenance switch. ([aetna.com](https://www.aetna.com/products/rxnonmedicare/data/2024/Zepbound_PA_with_Limit_Policy_6192-C_UDR_11-2023_v2.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you’d like, I can (a) scan specific payer formularies (UnitedHealthcare, Cigna/Express Scripts, CVS Caremark, Humana, state Medicaid plans) for any later announcements, or (b) monitor for any payer statements after Aug 7, 2025.

[285] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly publicly announced or disclosed a reinsurer plus large‑payer pilot that uses SURPASS‑CVOT inputs and a partial‑rebate 'cardiometabolic outcomes corridor' (where Lilly rebates if population MACE reduction misses a pre‑specified multi‑year target); if so, who are the participating payers/reinsurers, what were the stated performance targets and rebate mechanics, and where was the pilot disclosed? A: Short answer: I could not find any public disclosure by Eli Lilly, its investor/press releases, or major trade/press outlets (through Aug 7, 2025) announcing a reinsurer + large‑payer pilot that specifically uses SURPASS‑CVOT inputs and a partial‑rebate “cardiometabolic outcomes corridor” (rebates tied to population MACE reduction targets). Lilly’s recent SURPASS‑CVOT and Q2‑2025 disclosures mention the trial and commercial/partnering activity but do not describe such a pilot. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-mounjaro-tirzepatide-gipglp-1-dual-agonist-demonstrated?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Notes/next steps: Lilly has done outcomes‑based deals historically (e.g., Trulicity pay‑for‑performance examples), so the concept isn’t unprecedented — but I found no public pilot details (participants, targets, mechanics, or disclosure venue) as of that date. If you want, I can run a deeper, dated media/filings sweep (press, SEC, trade press, reinsurer releases) or monitor for announcements.

[286] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly publicly announced a memorandum of understanding, partnership, or integration agreement with retail‑clinic operators (for example, CVS or Walgreens MinuteClinics) to operationalize a standardized retail‑clinic prescribing pathway for orforglipron (including clinical decision support, standing‑order labs, and FHIR‑based PRO capture); if so, who are the partners, what are the implementation timelines, and where is the agreement posted? A: Short answer: I found no public memorandum of understanding, partnership, or integration announcement from Eli Lilly with CVS MinuteClinic, Walgreens/MinuteClinic, or other national retail‑clinic operators specifically to operationalize a standardized retail‑clinic prescribing pathway for orforglipron (CDS, standing‑order labs, FHIR PRO capture) as of Aug 7, 2025. Lilly’s orforglipron releases/FAQs discuss regulatory filing and launch planning but do not list such retail‑clinic agreements. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-delivers-weight-loss-average-273?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [lilly.com](https://www.lilly.com/news/stories/what-to-know-about-orforglipron?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) For context: retail/telehealth integrations exist for other Lilly products (e.g., Ro integration for Zepbound vials), showing Lilly works with digital providers—but that is not a retail‑clinic MinuteClinic MOU for orforglipron. ([prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ro-works-with-lilly-to-streamline-patient-access-to-authentic-zepbound-single-dose-vials-by-integrating-with-lillys-pharmacy-channel-302328012.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can run a targeted daily‑news check for any announcements after Aug 7, 2025.

[287] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly or a third party published a dose‑level lifecycle assessment (LCA) or third‑party environmental audit quantifying per‑dose metrics (for example, VOC grams per dose, water liters per dose, hazardous‑waste kg per dose, and incremental GHG emissions) associated with scaling oral incretin manufacturing from ~1.6× to ≥1.8× sellable doses in 2025; if such an LCA exists, what are the principal quantified findings and where is the report available? A: Short answer: No confirmed public dose‑level LCA or third‑party environmental audit meeting that description was found as of August 7, 2025. I searched Eli Lilly’s public sustainability disclosures and investor releases (which cite planned production increases ~1.6× in early‑2025) but do not publish a product‑level, per‑dose LCA or an audit quantifying VOC g/dose, L water/dose, hazardous‑waste kg/dose or incremental GHG for scaling from ~1.6×→≥1.8×. Independent literature reviews also note few medicine‑level LCAs available.

<a id="post-288"></a>
[288] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly or any third party published a standardized insurer actuarial microsimulation template that maps SURPASS hazard ratios (MACE/all‑cause), ATTAIN metabolic relative risks, and uptake/persistence scenarios into present‑value reserve or annuity impacts (for example, PV change per 100,000 treated over 5/10/20 years); if such a template or report exists, who authored it, what are the key inputs/outputs, and where is it publicly available? A: Short answer: No. I could not find any publicly available, standardized insurer actuarial microsimulation "template" (PV‑reserve or annuity impact per 100,000 treated over 5/10/20 years) published by Eli Lilly or by a third party as of Aug 7, 2025. Lilly has published SURPASS/ATTAIN trial results but not an insurer reserve/annuity template, reinsurers (Munich Re/Swiss Re) have thought‑leadership and proprietary metabolic/underwriting calculators (not a public PV‑reserve template), and academic groups publish health‑economic microsimulations scaled to per‑100,000 outcomes but those are not insurer reserve/annuity templates. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-delivers-weight-loss-average-273?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [munichre.com](https://www.munichre.com/landingpage/en/obesity-perspective/navigating-obesity-epidemic-through-enhanced-risk-management-solutions.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11909610/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you’d like, I can (a) run a deeper targeted search for any proprietary reports behind paywalls, or (b) draft a reproducible actuarial microsimulation template that maps published SURPASS/ATTAIN hazard ratios and uptake/persistence scenarios into PV reserve/annuity impacts.

[289] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly publicly committed to funding and registering a multi‑site community patient‑navigator and proactive GI‑adverse‑event management pilot targeting Medicaid, rural, and non‑English‑speaking populations with prespecified endpoints (for example, 12‑month persistence, initiation by payer/language, and QoL PROs); if so, provide the registration number, protocol summary, sample size, and where results or status are posted? A: Short answer: I could not find any public commitment or a registered clinical/implementation trial matching that exact description (multi‑site community patient‑navigator + proactive GI‑AE management pilot explicitly targeting Medicaid, rural, non‑English speakers with prespecified endpoints such as 12‑month persistence, stratified initiation by payer/language, and QoL PROs) as of Aug 7, 2025. My searches of Eli Lilly’s grant/press sites and clinical trial registries turned up Lilly grants, community‑health programs and many Lilly‑sponsored trials (including GLP‑1 product trials reporting GI AEs) but no public registration or protocol matching the pilot you describe. ([grantoffice.lilly.com](https://grantoffice.lilly.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-showed-compelling-efficacy-and?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [fdaaa.trialstracker.net](https://fdaaa.trialstracker.net/trial/NCT05767021/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you’d like, I can (1) run a deeper registry search (ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN, EU‑CTR), (2) search state Medicaid/CMS solicitations, and (3) check Lilly grant disclosures for any recent awards — and report any matches with registration numbers and protocol details.

[290] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly publicly committed to non‑exclusive supply or distribution terms for incretin manufacturing (for example, explicit commitments that it will not enter exclusive supply or preferred‑network contracts with specific contract manufacturers or PBMs); if so, provide the disclosure text, effective date, and where it is posted? A: Short answer: No authoritative public commitment was found. As of August 7, 2025, I could not locate any Eli Lilly disclosure expressly pledging to avoid exclusive or preferred‑network supply/distribution contracts for incretin manufacturing (e.g., a public statement “we will not enter exclusive supply or preferred‑network contracts with specific contract manufacturers or PBMs”). What I checked (representative sources): - Lilly SEC filings / 10‑K discuss supply risks and capacity expansion but do not contain such a non‑exclusive pledge. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947824000065/lly-20231231.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Lilly public statements/press releases (including the “Open Letter” about tirzepatide distribution and LillyDirect/Zepbound vial announcement) describe supply actions and channels but do not contain an explicit non‑exclusive commitment. ([lilly.gcs-web.com](https://lilly.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/open-letter-eli-lilly-and-company-regarding-certain-practices?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-releases-zepboundr-tirzepatide-single-dose-vials-expanding?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Limitations: absence of a finding in these public sources is not proof no such commitment exists elsewhere (e.g., a private contract, a jurisdictional filing, or a statement to a regulator). If you want, I can (a) re-run targeted searches of state/federal filings, antitrust/agency dockets, and recent news through Aug 7, 2025, or (b) search specific document sets (press releases, SEC exhibits, DOJ/FTC filings).

[291] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly publicly released a 'payer‑validation kit' or equivalent package that includes de‑identified or synthetic patient‑level ATTAIN and ACHIEVE datasets, full analysis code (including the prespecified primary estimand and MMRM/MI/tipping‑point sensitivity scripts), and an insurer‑facing economic scenario model; if so, where can that kit or repository be accessed and what data‑use/access terms apply? A: Short answer: I could find no public release of a single “payer‑validation kit” (de‑identified/synthetic ATTAIN+ACHIEVE patient‑level datasets + full analysis code + insurer economic model) by Eli Lilly as of Aug 7, 2025. Lilly has published trial results (press releases; NEJM paper for ACHIEVE‑1) but patient‑level data/code are provided on request via controlled platforms (Vivli/clinicalstudydatarequest) under an independent review, data‑sharing agreement, and secure research environment—not as an unrestricted public repository. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-delivers-weight-loss-average-273?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [ovid.com](https://www.ovid.com/journals/nejm/abstract/10.1056/nejmoa2505669~orforglipron-an-oral-small-molecule-glp-1-receptor-agonist?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [vivli.org](https://vivli.org/ourmember/lilly/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can: (a) search Lilly’s Vivli study listings for the specific ATTAIN/ACHIEVE packages and their request/DSA terms, or (b) draft the exact proposal text needed to request the IPD and analysis files.

[292] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly published an investor‑facing brief or one‑pager that maps ATTAIN/ACHIEVE prespecified primary estimand(s) and missing‑data methods to ITT and treatment‑regimen results and shows scenario tables for low/medium/high uptake and persistence with corresponding placebo‑adjusted weight‑loss, AE‑driven discontinuation and topline revenue implications; if such a brief exists, what is its title, publication date, and where can it be accessed? A: Short answer: I could not find any Eli Lilly investor‑facing “one‑pager” or brief exactly matching that description as of Aug 7, 2025. What I checked (examples) - Lilly ATTAIN‑1 press release (Aug 7, 2025) — reports efficacy estimand results but is a press release, not an investor one‑pager mapping estimands/missing‑data to ITT/treatment‑regimen with scenario revenue tables. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-delivers-weight-loss-average-273?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Lilly ACHIEVE/NEJM release and ADA investor event materials (June 21–22, 2025) — detailed results and investor presentation available, but I found no standalone investor brief with the specific estimand → ITT/treatment‑regimen mapping plus uptake/persistence → revenue scenario tables. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-showed-compelling-efficacy-and?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can (a) search more widely (analyst notes, SEC 8‑Ks, or uploaded slide PDFs) or (b) pull the relevant Lilly press release / ADA slide deck and check slides for any partial material. Which do you prefer?

[293] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly published a 'proof‑of‑capacity' stress‑test report showing two geographically separated qualified sites (internal or contract manufacturers) each sustaining ≥25% of the incremental sellable‑dose target for eight consecutive weeks and reporting weekly qualified‑batch counts and median lot‑release times; if such data were published, where can the eight‑week batch counts, lot‑release times, and site identities be found? A: Short answer: No reliable public record of such a "proof‑of‑capacity" stress‑test report from Eli Lilly was found as of August 7, 2025. What I checked (representative sources) - Lilly’s manufacturing/capacity pages and news releases (company disclosures show large expansions but no eight‑week stress‑test batch/lot‑release dataset). ([lilly.com](https://www.lilly.com/medicines/safety/manufacturing-quality?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Lilly’s SEC filings (10‑K/8‑K/press releases) list capacity investments and supply‑risk disclosures but do not publish per‑site eight‑week qualified‑batch counts, median lot‑release times, or a stress‑test report. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/59478/000005947825000067/lly-20241231.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Industry reporting notes Lilly declines to disclose detailed CDMO/site-level production partners and did not publish granular public batch‑count/lot‑release tables. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/f7bc9af9-4643-481a-94e8-ac87547123a8?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Where those data would appear if published - Eli Lilly investor news / press releases or a dedicated PDF on lilly.com; or - A public SEC filing (Form 8‑K, 10‑Q/10‑K) or contractual disclosure to HHS/BARDA/FDA (if part of a government agreement). (Check Lilly’s IR/SEC pages and HHS/BARDA/Federal contract portals.) If you want, I can (a) run a deeper site/filing search limited to Aug 7, 2025 snapshots, or (b) monitor Lilly IR, SEC, and HHS/BARDA pages and alert you if such a report appears.

A: Short answer: I could not find any publicly posted DSMB charters or independent event‑adjudication (CEC/EAC) charters or full membership lists for ATTAIN‑1 (orforglipron) or for SURPASS‑CVOT (MACE adjudication) as of August 7, 2025. I checked Lilly’s trial pages/press release and trial registry/publication materials but did not find charter PDFs or committee rosters.

[295] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly publicly announced FDA clearance or an Emergency Use Authorization for a companion diagnostic plasma p‑tau assay intended to support donanemab patient selection, or publicly confirmed submission/acceptance for FDA–CMS parallel review for a donanemab CDx; if so, what is the diagnostic name, the clearance or acceptance date, and where is the regulatory action documented? A: Short answer: No. I found no public Eli Lilly announcement (press release, SEC/Investor filing, or FDA listing) saying Lilly obtained FDA clearance or an EUA for a plasma p‑tau companion diagnostic for donanemab, nor that Lilly confirmed a formal submission/acceptance into an FDA–CMS parallel review for a donanemab CDx as of Aug 7, 2025. Roche (a collaborator) reported FDA Breakthrough Device designation for its Elecsys pTau217 (Apr 11, 2024), and Fujirebio’s Lumipulse G pTau217/Abeta1‑42 plasma ratio received FDA 510(k) clearance (K242706, decision date May 16, 2025). Lilly’s donanemab press releases do not document a Lilly CDx clearance or parallel‑review acceptance.

[296] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly operationalized and publicly disclosed a payer‑grade psychosocial monitoring protocol integrated into ATTAIN/ACHIEVE trials or LillyDirect that prespecifies instruments (for example, PHQ‑9, GAD‑7, IWQOL‑Lite‑CT), collection windows (baseline, 3, 6, 12 months), and safety‑escalation thresholds (for example, PHQ‑9 increase ≥5 or positive suicidal‑ideation item); if so, list the instruments, collection schedule, thresholds, and where the protocol is published? A: Short answer: No — I could not find a publicly posted, single “payer‑grade” psychosocial monitoring protocol from Eli Lilly (covering ATTAIN/ACHIEVE or LillyDirect) that both (a) prespecifies a fixed instrument set (PHQ‑9, GAD‑7, IWQOL‑Lite‑CT, etc.), (b) a payer-style visit schedule (baseline, 3, 6, 12 months), and (c) explicit safety‑escalation thresholds (e.g., PHQ‑9 Δ≥5 or a positive suicidal‑ideation item). Public trial registries and Lilly materials list PROs used (IWQOL‑Lite‑CT, SF‑36 and other PROs in ATTAIN/ACHIEVE) and safety tools are used in related trials (PHQ/C‑SSRS noted in some study records), but I found no unified, published escalation‑threshold protocol. ([ichgcp.net](https://ichgcp.net/clinical-trials-registry/NCT05931380?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-launches-end-end-digital-healthcare-experience-through/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can (a) search specific study protocols/appendices (Vivli/ClinicalTrials.gov) for each ATTAIN/ACHIEVE study or (b) file a data‑request path to Lilly/Vivli for the trial protocol.

[297] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, have major U.S. pharmacy benefit managers (for example, CVS Caremark, Cigna/Express Scripts, and UnitedHealthcare) publicly published prior‑authorization criteria, step‑therapy requirements, BMI or comorbidity thresholds, or other utilization‑management rules specific to GLP‑1 anti‑obesity drugs; if so, for each PBM list the exact thresholds and where each policy is publicly posted? A: As of Aug 7, 2025 — yes. Public PBM policies with exact thresholds: - Express Scripts / Evernorth: published PA PDF. Adults ≥18; BMI ≥30 or BMI ≥27 + ≥1 weight‑related comorbidity; ≥3 months behavioral/lifestyle trial before initiation; initial authorizations: Saxenda 4 mo, Wegovy 7 mo, Zepbound 8 mo; continuation: Saxenda ≥4% weight loss, Wegovy ≥5% weight loss, Zepbound generally ≥5% (OSA-specific rules require different/stricter targets including 10% after 1 year). (Express Scripts PA policy PDF). ([express-scripts.com](https://www.express-scripts.com/sites/default/files/policies/Weight%20Loss%20-%20Glucagon-Like%20Peptide-1%20Agonists%20PA%20Policy_5.pdf)) - UnitedHealthcare / OptumRx: published commercial PA document. Adults ≥30 BMI (or ≥27 + comorbidity); used as adjunct to lifestyle program; initial auth lengths (example: Wegovy 5 mo, Zepbound 6 mo); reauthorization generally requires ≥5% weight loss (Saxenda 4%, Qsymia 3%). (UHC provider PA PDF). ([uhcprovider.com](https://www.uhcprovider.com/content/dam/provider/docs/public/prior-auth/drugs-pharmacy/commercial/r-z/PA-Notification-Weight-Loss.pdf)) - CVS Caremark: CVS communications (formulary change notices) and plan notices (e.g., GIC/CVS briefings) state BMI thresholds (≥30 or ≥27 + comorbidity), requirement to document enrollment/participation in a weight‑management program (commonly 3–6 months) and continuation often requires ≥5% weight loss; CVS formulary/PA details are published in plan notices and vendor/vendor‑partner pages (Caremark prior‑auth guidance, state/plan notices). (Mass.gov summary; Novo Nordisk coverage guide). ([mass.gov](https://www.mass.gov/news/cvs-caremark-decides-to-remove-zepbound-from-cvs-caremark-formulary), [novomedlink.com](https://www.novomedlink.com/obesity/products/treatments/wegovy/cost-coverage/wegovy-coverage-savings.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want direct PDFs or the specific line‑by‑line clauses for a given plan (employer/Medicaid/Medicare differences), I can fetch and attach them.

[298] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly deposited anonymized patient‑level ATTAIN and ACHIEVE trial datasets in a controlled‑access repository (for example, Vivli) concurrent with journal or EASD publication; if so, provide the repository accession identifiers, deposition dates, and access conditions or URLs? A: Short answer: No public controlled‑access deposit was identifiable as of Aug 7, 2025. I found no Vivli (or other repository) accession ID or dataset DOI posted concurrently with the ACHIEVE (NEJM publication, June 21, 2025) or ATTAIN (Lilly press release / EASD presentation, Aug 7, 2025) outputs. ClinicalTrials.gov / trial records state Eli Lilly’s IPD plan: anonymized participant‑level data will be provided via a secure access environment (Vivli) after primary publication AND regulatory approval (typically “6 months after…approval”), with requests subject to independent review — which explains why no immediate public deposit/ accession is available. ([ovid.com](https://www.ovid.com/journals/nejm/abstract/10.1056/nejmoa2505669~orforglipron-an-oral-small-molecule-glp-1-receptor-agonist?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-delivers-weight-loss-average-273?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [ichgcp.net](https://ichgcp.net/clinical-trials-registry/NCT05869903?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can (a) search Vivli and other repositories again for any later uploads/IDs, or (b) draft the exact data‑request text and steps to request these datasets from Vivli/Lilly.

[299] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 7, 2025, has Eli Lilly publicly established or published the charter for an independent, equity‑focused post‑approval registry for orforglipron governed by a multi‑stakeholder board with a pre‑registered protocol, informed‑consent for EMR/claims linkage, prespecified subgroup endpoints, and a public dashboard; if so, provide the registry title, protocol identifier, governance details, and dashboard URL or publication source? A: Short answer: No. I found no public charter, pre‑registered post‑approval protocol, multi‑stakeholder governance document, informed‑consent/EMR‑claims linkage plan, prespecified subgroup endpoints, or public dashboard for an independent, equity‑focused orforglipron post‑approval registry as of August 7, 2025. Lilly’s public materials on orforglipron describe Phase‑3 trials and regulatory submission plans but do not identify any such post‑marketing registry or charter. ([investor.lilly.com](https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-oral-glp-1-orforglipron-delivers-weight-loss-average-273?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [lilly.com](https://www.lilly.com/news/stories/what-to-know-about-orforglipron?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [ichgcp.net](https://ichgcp.net/clinical-trials-registry/NCT06672939?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you’d like, I can (a) search FDA post‑marketing commitments, journal supplements, or registry platforms (ClinicalTrials.gov, ISRCTN, EU‑CTR, Vivli) for any observ ational/registry records after Aug 7, 2025, or (b) monitor Lilly’s investor/press pages and trial registries and report back.
