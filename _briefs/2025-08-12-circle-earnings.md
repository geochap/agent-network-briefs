# Circle Q2-25 Earnings Call: Multi-Perspective Analysis & Strategic Outlook

> **Disclaimer**: This report was generated by a network of simulated agents as part of an experimental research system.

## Executive Summary

Circle’s first public quarter landed with strong growth signals and a bolder platform stance. Q2 revenue plus reserve income reached $658m with adjusted EBITDA of $126m, while USDC circulation rose to $61.3bn at quarter‑end and $65.2bn by Aug 10; on‑chain volume expanded 5.4x YoY to ~$5.9T and “meaningful wallets” grew 68% YoY, indicating broadening usage and distribution. Yet the revenue mix remains highly rate‑exposed (≈96% of Q2 revenue plus reserve income from reserves), with RLDC margin at 38% and “other revenue” contributing a modest 2.2pp uplift—underscoring the stakes for scaling high‑margin, usage‑linked fees. Management frames the U.S. GENIUS Act as a structural tailwind for bank‑grade adoption and venue/custody clarity for payment stablecoins in the U.S./EU, but acknowledges rollouts at large FIs will take time.

Strategically, Circle is tightening the loop between yield, liquidity, and utility. USYC–USDC 24/7 convertibility and Binance collateralization create an investable “cash + margin” sleeve for institutions, while Gateway’s single‑balance abstraction and USDC‑as‑gas aim to eliminate onboarding friction and operational float—positioning Circle to monetize volume through CPN, Gateway, and eventually Arc gas fees as rate income normalizes. The company touts rising first‑party fee surfaces and 10% of supply on its platform as scaffolding for transaction/other revenue tied to usage rather than balances. Early CPN corridors (HK, BR, NG, MX) and Arc’s enterprise‑grade design with USDC gas and deterministic finality extend this thesis into payments and FX.

Tensions concentrate in execution risk and legal perimeter. A Fed easing cycle would compress reserve income; partner incentives could keep RLDC tight, and a 2025–26 dual squeeze is plausible if rate cuts coincide with Arc displacing some high‑margin blockchain‑partner revenues. CPN scaling depends on licensed PSPs, 24/7 liquidity, and Travel Rule controls in complex FX/capital‑control markets; refund/chargeback regimes (e.g., Pix MED) can clash with deterministic finality, implying potential escrow/prefunding drag. Key operating metrics (CPN corridor SLAs, FX spreads, failure rates; USYC→USDC latency/uptime) and CPN rulebooks are not publicly disclosed—limiting investors’ ability to underwrite TPV ramp, conversion friction, and unit economics.

Arc amplifies both upside and regulatory uncertainty. If predictable USDC fees replace elastic markets, spam/DoS resistance may hinge on non‑price controls that centralize discretion and could blunt open‑network effects; litepaper language points to vetted/known institutions as validators and opt‑in privacy aligned to Travel Rule needs, but public docs remain sparse on fee algorithms, congestion controls, validator KYC/capital criteria, initial validator count, and U.S. access policy. Meanwhile, Arc’s native PvP FX risks being scoped as a trading venue/payment system in the EU or ATS/SEF/retail‑forex in the U.S., potentially forcing ECP‑only gating, geofencing, or cost‑intensive licensing—issues on which regulators have not yet opined specifically on Arc. [[63]](#post-63) [[112]](#post-112) [[81]](#post-81) [[113]](#post-113) [[114]](#post-114) [[106]](#post-106) [[94]](#post-94) [[69]](#post-69) [[87]](#post-87) [[76]](#post-76) [[111]](#post-111)

Net, the investable case is a race between a strengthening trust flywheel and macro “digital dollarization” versus unresolved perimeter and execution risks. GENIUS/MiCA clarity, market‑neutral distribution, and embedded channels (payments processors, exchanges) support durable USDC demand and volume‑linked fees that can buffer rate compression. To underwrite the pivot from rate‑driven to usage‑driven monetization, investors should press for: corridor‑level SLAs and fee/FX disclosures; audited linkages between on‑chain volume and monetized products; Arc’s validator blueprint and U.S. FX access policy; and updated interest‑rate sensitivity alongside targets for “other revenue” growth versus velocity.

## Platform Strategy & Product Differentiation (ARC, Gateway, CPN, USYC/USDC)

Circle’s platform strategy is to collapse the stablecoin stack into a coherent, enterprise‑grade bundle that reduces onboarding friction and broadens fee surfaces. Management positions Arc (USDC‑as‑gas, deterministic finality, native FX), Gateway (single‑balance abstraction over chains), and CPN (governed cross‑border payouts) as complementary layers: Arc for predictable fees and settlement, Gateway to hide chain complexity, and CPN to stitch on/off‑ramps and payout partners into corridors. Together with the USYC–USDC pairing (yield collateral plus spendable cash), the aim is to turn velocity into monetizable transaction/“other” revenue as reserve yields normalize. [[61]](#post-61) [[49]](#post-49) [[10]](#post-10) [[23]](#post-23) [[62]](#post-62) [[80]](#post-80)

Differentiation leans on market‑neutral distribution (exchanges, processors, wallets), regulatory credentials, and UX that makes crypto “invisible.” Arc’s USDC‑denominated gas and Gateway’s chain abstraction target two of the most persistent pain points (native‑token gas and wrong‑chain sends), while CPN’s corridor focus meets remittance and B2B needs where local liquidity, FX, and refund norms matter. The bet is that this integrated approach compounds trust and adoption across institutional and retail channels, creating durable, volume‑linked fee optionality across Arc gas, Gateway, and CPN.

### Minority / Dissent

> “If ARC targets bounded/predictable USDC fees, spam/DoS resistance likely shifts from price to non-price controls (identity quotas, allowlists, or centralized scheduling), concentrating discretion in vetted validators and reducing permissionless composability—eroding developer-driven network effects versus open L1s.” [[63]](#post-63)  
— Blockchain Infrastructure Lead; Support: 8

> “EM consumer‑protection rules (e.g., Brazil’s Pix MED) mandate post‑payment revocation/return windows that conflict with ARC’s deterministic finality; CPN members may need prefunding/escrow to honor refunds and FX reversals, tying up capital and pressuring RLDC as volumes scale.” [[116]](#post-116)  
— Financial Regulator (Emerging Markets); Support: 8

### Analysis
The dominant view is that Circle’s integrated stack (Arc gas‑in‑USDC, Gateway abstraction, CPN corridors) plus regulatory positioning can compress onboarding friction and unlock volume‑linked fees. The dissent cautions that Arc’s predictable‑fee goal may require centralized non‑price congestion controls that dilute open‑network effects, and that EM refund regimes can collide with deterministic finality, introducing escrow/prefunding drag. Key unknowns sustaining this split: Arc’s concrete fee/congestion design and validator blueprint (docs still sparse) and access policies for FX; and CPN’s corridor‑level SLAs and refund/liability rules, which aren’t public. Investors should watch for Arc testnet/specs on fees/spam controls and validator KYC/governance, and for published CPN rulebook extracts and corridor metrics to validate the flywheel without sacrificing openness or unit economics.

## Regulatory & Compliance Landscape Post-GENIUS Act & MiCA

Regulatory clarity is emerging as a critical swing factor for Circle’s investability. The U.S. GENIUS Act formalizes a federal regime for “permitted payment stablecoin issuers” (PPSIs), excludes PPSI‑issued payment stablecoins from “security” status, and prohibits paying interest—changes Circle flags as materially affecting its business with rulemaking and effective‑date timelines now set. In parallel, Circle’s MiCA pathway (EMI authorization in France) reduces EU ambiguity. Together these developments narrow venue/custody uncertainty for USDC in payments/settlement and ease large‑institution integrations (banks, card networks, broker‑dealers). [[93]](#post-93) [[102]](#post-102) [[118]](#post-118)

The same perimeter that confers clarity also creates new edge‑cases for Arc and cross‑border corridors. Arc’s native PvP FX with vetted validators could be scoped as a trading venue/payment system (EU MiFID II MTF/PSR; U.S. ATS/SEF), or as retail‑forex if accessible to U.S. non‑ECPs—implications that would raise opex, require gating/geofencing, and slow onboarding. FATF Travel Rule and local PSP/FX licensing obligations may extend to validators and corridors (e.g., Brazil/Mexico/Nigeria), with data‑localization and capital‑control constraints adding compliance drag. EU supervisors have also flagged PSD2/MiCA interplay for EMT‑linked “network fees.” Notably, public materials do not yet specify Arc’s U.S. access policy (e.g., ECP‑only) and validators’ admission/KYC blueprint, and no U.S./EU regulator has opined specifically on Arc’s venue status as of the call date.

### Minority / Dissent

> ARC’s “native FX engine” with Circle‑vetted validators may trigger trading‑venue/payment‑system obligations (EU MiFID II MTF/PSR; US ATS/SEF or designated payment system) because it enables centrally governed multilateral PVP price formation and settlement in USDC, giving Circle operator control and access rules. Licensing, capital, transparency, surveillance, and fair‑access could materially raise costs and slow onboarding.  
— Crypto Legal Counsel (Capital Markets); Support: 8 [[69]](#post-69)

> Genius Act’s ban on paying interest to stablecoin holders is a corporate‑treasury adoption headwind: enterprises expect yield on operational cash, but auto‑sweeping USDC into USYC likely requires segregated wallets, suitability/ECP gating, and retail exclusions—driving either lower USDC working balances (shrinking reserve income) or richer partner incentives to hold float, pressuring RLDC.  
— Institutional Portfolio Manager; Support: 8 [[119]](#post-119)

### Analysis
The dominant view is that GENIUS/MiCA clarity de‑risks core payments/settlement use of USDC and strengthens Circle’s institutional distribution. The counterpoint is perimeter risk: Arc’s FX and validator model could fall inside trading‑venue/payment‑system or retail‑forex regimes, and GENIUS’s interest ban may dampen corporate‑treasury working‑cash adoption absent sweep frameworks. Key uncertainties include pending regulator interpretations on Arc’s venue status, U.S. access gating (ECP‑only or broader), validator KYC/jurisdictional design, and corridor‑specific licensing under capital‑control regimes; none were finalized as of Aug 12, 2025. Investors should track GENIUS implementing rules/timelines, EU PSD2/MiCA supervision on EMT‑linked fee models, and Circle’s published licensing/KYC blueprint and U.S. Arc access policy.

## Revenue Model Exposure & Financial Resilience

Circle’s earnings mix remains highly rate‑dependent. In Q2‑25, total revenue plus reserve income was $658m, with ≈96% from reserve income; RLDC margin was 38%, and “other revenue” (largely subscription/services and transaction fees) added 2.2pp to margin but is still small in dollar terms. Interest‑rate sensitivity is material: a ±100 bp parallel move changes annualized reserve income by roughly ±$618m. This places a premium on scaling high‑margin, usage‑linked fees to offset potential Fed‑cut compression. [[73]](#post-73) [[79]](#post-79) [[77]](#post-77)

Management’s resilience thesis leans on three levers: macro/regulatory tailwinds that deepen USDC adoption, new first‑party fee surfaces (Gateway/CPN/Arc gas) tied to volume rather than balances, and product architecture that broadens institutional use (e.g., USYC collateral + USDC settlement). The open question for investors is execution pace: fee and “other” revenue grew 3.5× YoY, but on‑chain USDC volume rose ~5.4×, suggesting monetization may lag usage unless new surfaces ramp quickly.

### Supporting Voices

> “Reserve-income sensitivity: a Fed easing cycle would compress short-end yields, reducing net reserve income even if USDC supply grows, while partner incentives to win share could keep RLDC margins tight; high‑margin ‘other revenue’ must scale faster to offset.” [[67]](#post-67)

### Minority / Dissent

> “RLDC margin faces a 2025–26 dual squeeze if rates fall while ARC cannibalizes ‘other revenue’: lower reserve yields cut income as partner incentives (often balance/volume‑linked) stay sticky, and shifting from chain‑partner integrations to a proprietary L1 could displace high‑margin blockchain partnership fees that added 2.2pp in Q2.” [[68]](#post-68)  
— Independent Market Skeptic & Columnist; Support: 5

### Analysis
The central tension is whether diversified, usage‑linked fees and macro/regulatory tailwinds can outpace rate compression and incentive drag. Bulls point to GENIUS‑enabled institutional adoption and EM “digital dollarization” expanding USDC float and volume‑based monetization (Gateway/CPN/Arc), while bears highlight high beta to short rates, sticky partner incentives, and potential cannibalization of high‑margin partner fees as Arc matures. Key uncertainties: the ramp rate of “other revenue” versus velocity, sustained partner‑fee economics, and how quickly new fee surfaces can narrow the gap with usage growth. Watch interest‑rate paths and disclosures tying on‑chain volume to monetized products to validate resilience. [[77]](#post-77) [[80]](#post-80) [[73]](#post-73) [[79]](#post-79) [[90]](#post-90)

## Execution & Scaling Constraints in Global Corridors

Scaling cross-border corridors is where Circle’s strategy meets real-world frictions. CPN depends on licensed local payout partners with 24/7 liquidity, adherence to FX/capital controls, and full Travel Rule screening, while Circle’s own onboarding capacity and partner diligence can elongate go‑lives—delaying TPV and fee capture. Public materials confirm only four live corridors (Hong Kong, Brazil, Nigeria, Mexico), and corridor‑level SLAs and fee/FX metrics are not published, limiting underwriting of reliability and unit economics. [[64]](#post-64) [[75]](#post-75) [[71]](#post-71) [[103]](#post-103)

Emerging market consumer‑protection regimes (e.g., Pix MED in Brazil) can clash with deterministic finality, forcing prefunding/escrow to honor refunds and FX reversals—tying up capital just as volumes scale. Local regulatory stances further complicate expansion: Brazil’s consultation contemplates treating stablecoin cross‑border operations as FX activity; Mexico restricts FI operations in virtual assets absent authorization; Nigeria allows bank accounts for VASPs with restrictive conditions—each adding licensing/reporting burdens and operational constraints.

[[83]](#post-83)  
— Crypto Legal Counsel (Capital Markets); Support: 8

### Analysis
The split centers on execution bottlenecks versus mitigants. The dominant view stresses operational and regulatory drag: dependency on local PSPs under FX/capital controls, lack of public corridor SLAs/metrics, and refund regimes that may force capital‑intensive prefunding—each slowing TPV ramp and clouding unit economics. The minority counters that Circle’s existing authorizations and processor partnerships can compress onboarding timelines and reduce licensing friction. Key uncertainties remain: publication of corridor‑level SLAs and fee/FX metrics, disclosure of refund/liability rules, the pace of adding banked corridors, and final national treatments of stablecoin‑based FX—without which investors cannot fully underwrite scaling velocity and margin impact.

## Adoption Drivers, User Trust & Macro Tailwinds

Adoption depends on two reinforcing engines: trust and utility. Circle is compressing user friction via “invisible crypto” UX (Gateway’s single-balance abstraction, USDC-as-gas) and market‑neutral distribution through familiar brands (exchanges, processors, remitters). This lowers onboarding complexity for first‑time users and enterprises, while corridor builds (CPN) aim to anchor real‑economy use in remittances and B2B payouts. Simultaneously, macro conditions and new U.S./EU policy clarity are pulling demand onto USDC rails, particularly in inflationary or capital‑controlled markets.

The dominant perspective is that GENIUS/MiCA clarity and embedded distribution will accelerate mainstream adoption, compounding trust and velocity. A minority warns that specific frictions—interest bans for “cash” stablecoins, EM refund/recourse rules, and corridor dependencies—could slow corporate treasury uptake and impose operational drag unless Circle publishes clear consumer‑protection standards and corridor metrics.

### Analysis
The split reflects where adoption bottlenecks arise: dominant voices see regulatory clarity plus embedded, low‑friction UX driving mainstream uptake and durable, non‑speculative flows; dissenters focus on practical constraints—corporate cash expectations for yield under the GENIUS interest ban and EM refund regimes that can force capital‑intensive safeguards. Key uncertainties for investors: whether Circle publishes corridor‑level fees/ETAs/failure rates and consumer‑protection standards to harden trust; how quickly USYC‑linked sweep frameworks gain regulatory comfort for corporates; and how EM refund/liability rules are operationalized within CPN without eroding unit economics.

## Technical Architecture & Network Governance Risks

Arc’s architecture decisions are inseparable from its regulatory perimeter and economic model. Circle has signaled USDC-as-gas, deterministic finality via vetted professional validators, opt‑in confidentiality, and a “native FX engine” as core design choices; management also referenced a “novel fee mechanism” aimed at predictable, low costs, while deferring details to testnet. Public materials and the litepaper excerpts indicate a permissioned PoA-style validator set of known institutions with privacy features designed to support Travel Rule compliance—yet fee algorithms, block limits, spam/DoS controls, validator KYC/capital criteria, and U.S. access policies remain largely unspecified in public docs as of the call. [[23]](#post-23) [[29]](#post-29) [[112]](#post-112) [[81]](#post-81) [[113]](#post-113) [[114]](#post-114) [[96]](#post-96) [[106]](#post-106) [[94]](#post-94)

The dominant risk perspective is that targeting bounded/predictable fees and operating with Circle‑vetted validators will shift congestion control from market pricing to non‑price mechanisms, centralizing discretion and weakening permissionless composability. Compounding this, Arc’s centrally governed PvP FX and validator operations may pull the system into trading‑venue/payment‑system regimes and FATF “obliged entity” obligations across corridors—implying gatekeeping, geofencing, and higher compliance opex. Counter‑voices emphasize that avoiding a native L1 token and charging fees in USDC may simplify legal exposure and fee monetization within PPSI/MiCA‑EMI perimeters.

### Analysis
The divergence hinges on openness versus institutional control. Proponents of predictable, USDC‑denominated fees and vetted validators see institutional readiness and compliance alignment; critics warn that non‑price congestion controls and operator discretion could suppress developer network effects and entangle Arc in venue/payment‑system and Travel Rule obligations—forcing access gating and higher opex. Key unknowns heightening model risk: concrete fee/congestion algorithms (and whether elastic pricing survives), validator admission/KYC and scale, and U.S. access policy for FX (e.g., ECP‑only). What would resolve it: testnet specs demonstrating elastic pricing without allowlists [[63]](#post-63), a published multi‑jurisdiction licensing/KYC blueprint for validators [[65]](#post-65), and regulator opinions clarifying that Arc’s FX is not a multilateral venue/payment system [[69]](#post-69).

## Materiality & Impact Assessment

### **Theme 1 — Platform Strategy & Product Differentiation (ARC, Gateway, CPN, USYC/USDC)**

#### **Scale**
- Multi‑product stack expands monetizable surfaces beyond reserve income: Arc gas‑in‑USDC, CPN fees, Gateway fees, premium Circle Mint features, and USYC collateralization economics. Management affirmed Arc gas fees as a new revenue line and highlighted growing transaction fee streams across products. [[61]](#post-61)
- Usage signals are large and rising: USDC on‑chain volume up 5.4× YoY to ~$5.9T; “meaningful wallets” +68% YoY; 10% of USDC now on Circle’s platform, increasing first‑party fee capture potential. [[45]](#post-45) [[90]](#post-90) [[92]](#post-92) [[91]](#post-91)
- Differentiated UX reduces friction: Gateway’s single‑balance abstraction and USDC‑as‑gas remove wrong‑chain sends and native‑token hurdles; expected to lower support/ops overhead and speed time‑to‑live for enterprises. [[82]](#post-82)
- Institutional liquidity loop: USYC–USDC 24/7 convertibility plus exchange collateralization enables “cash + margin” sleeves for institutions, improving liquidity utilization and creating optionality to monetize Arc gas/CPN flows as volume scales. [[62]](#post-62)

#### **Timing**
- Already visible in Q2 (transaction revenues up; other revenues 3.5× YoY) with continued acceleration into Q3; Gateway launched in July; CPN live in four corridors; Arc announced with testnet targeted for fall 2025. [[45]](#post-45) [[75]](#post-75) [[23]](#post-23) [[61]](#post-61)

#### **Dependencies**
- USYC↔USDC performance and convertibility economics remain within tight bounds:
  - [Falsifier: Slippage >10 bps or USYC→USDC latency >5s] [[62]](#post-62)
- Arc publishes credible fee/congestion mechanics that maintain predictability without eroding composability:
  - [Status: UNKNOWN; Testnet specs requested] [[29]](#post-29) [[81]](#post-81) [[113]](#post-113)
- CPN corridor reliability and economics are transparent to sustain adoption:
  - [Publish SLAs, spreads, median settlement times, failure/reversal rates] [[71]](#post-71) [[103]](#post-103) [[97]](#post-97)
- Continued partner distribution (exchanges, processors, remitters) to feed the flywheel:
  - [Visa/Mastercard/Fiserv/FIS/Matera/Shopify/OKX/Binance integrations] [[23]](#post-23) [[15]](#post-15) [[82]](#post-82) [[84]](#post-84)

#### **Net Impact**
- Likely positive. The integrated stack targets core frictions and links fee monetization to usage (Gateway/CPN/Arc), while institutional liquidity design (USYC+USDC) deepens utility. Key sensitivities: Arc’s congestion‑control design (risk of centralization), corridor SLAs/FX transparency, and execution capacity to onboard partners at scale. [[80]](#post-80) [[63]](#post-63) [[71]](#post-71) [[64]](#post-64)


### **Theme 2 — Regulatory & Compliance Landscape Post-GENIUS Act & MiCA**

#### **Scale**
- Structural clarity: GENIUS Act’s PPSI regime and exclusion of PPSI‑issued payment stablecoins from “security” status, combined with EU MiCA EMI authorization, reduce venue/custody ambiguity—material for bank/card/broker integrations. [[93]](#post-93) [[102]](#post-102)
- Constraint on “cash” yield: statutory ban on paying interest to payment‑stablecoin holders may dampen corporate‑treasury working‑cash adoption absent compliant sweep frameworks to USYC. [[118]](#post-118) [[119]](#post-119)
- Arc perimeter risks: native PvP FX under Circle‑governed access/validators may trigger ATS/SEF (U.S.) or MTF/PSR (EU) or payment‑system obligations; Travel Rule and local PSP/FX licensing could extend to validators/corridors. [[69]](#post-69) [[87]](#post-87) [[65]](#post-65)

#### **Timing**
- GENIUS effective on the earlier of 18 months after enactment (signals into 2026–27) or 120 days post‑final rules; rulemaking due within 1 year of enactment. [[93]](#post-93) [[105]](#post-105)
- No specific U.S./EU regulator determinations on Arc’s venue/payment‑system status as of Aug 12, 2025. [[76]](#post-76)

#### **Dependencies**
- Timely and favorable GENIUS/MiCA implementing rules:
  - [Final rules within 1 year; effective date alignment] [[93]](#post-93) [[105]](#post-105)
- Arc access policy and validator blueprint aligned to perimeter:
  - [U.S. ECP‑only gating/geofencing decisions; validator KYC/jurisdiction/capital] [[94]](#post-94) [[87]](#post-87) [[106]](#post-106) [[112]](#post-112)
- National corridor treatments on stablecoin FX/payment services:
  - [Brazil/Mexico/Nigeria guidance/licensing/reporting] [[111]](#post-111)

#### **Net Impact**
- Ambiguous. Clearer PPSI/MiCA regimes are strong tailwinds for USDC in payments/settlement, but Arc’s FX/validator model could impose venue/payment‑system and Travel‑Rule burdens that raise opex, necessitate gating, and slow onboarding. Corporate‑treasury uptake may be capped by the interest ban without regulator‑blessed sweep structures. [[102]](#post-102) [[69]](#post-69) [[119]](#post-119)


### **Theme 3 — Revenue Model Exposure & Financial Resilience**

#### **Scale**
- High rate‑dependence: ≈96% of Q2 revenue+reserve income from reserve income; RLDC margin 38%. A ±100 bp parallel rate move shifts annualized reserve income by ~±$618m. [[73]](#post-73) [[79]](#post-79) [[77]](#post-77)
- Offsets in progress but nascent: “Other revenue” $24m in Q2 (+3.5× YoY) with +2.2pp RLDC contribution; transaction revenue $5.8m. [[45]](#post-45) [[79]](#post-79) [[90]](#post-90)
- Usage‑linked fee optionality: Gateway/CPN/Arc gas intended to scale with USDC velocity and on‑platform share (10%), cushioning rate compression. [[80]](#post-80) [[91]](#post-91)

#### **Timing**
- 2025 guidance: other revenue $75–85m; RLDC margin 36–38%; risk of a 2025–26 dual squeeze if rates fall while Arc displaces high‑margin blockchain‑partner fees. [[56]](#post-56) [[68]](#post-68) [[67]](#post-67)

#### **Dependencies**
  - Short‑rate path and reserve yields:
    - [Fed easing cycle would compress reserve income] [[67]](#post-67) [[77]](#post-77)
  - Execution on usage‑linked monetization:
    - [Scale Gateway/CPN/Arc gas; tie fees to volume growth] [[80]](#post-80) [[61]](#post-61)
  - Partner‑incentive discipline and mix:
    - [Incentives elevated; maintain blockchain‑partner fee streams] [[45]](#post-45) [[68]](#post-68) [[79]](#post-79)

#### **Net Impact**
- Ambiguous. If usage‑linked fees scale with velocity, they can buffer rate compression; if not, earnings remain highly rate‑sensitive and margins could tighten—especially if partner incentives stay sticky and Arc cannibalizes higher‑margin partnership revenue. [[67]](#post-67) [[68]](#post-68) [[80]](#post-80)


### **Theme 4 — Execution & Scaling Constraints in Global Corridors**

#### **Scale**
- CPN scaling hinges on licensed PSPs, 24/7 liquidity, Travel‑Rule screening, and Circle’s onboarding bandwidth—risks elongating go‑lives and delaying TPV and fees. [[64]](#post-64)
- Only four live corridors disclosed (HK, BR, NG, MX); corridor‑level SLAs, FX spreads, settlement times, and failure rates are not publicly posted—limiting underwriting of reliability and unit economics. [[75]](#post-75) [[71]](#post-71) [[103]](#post-103)
- EM consumer‑protection (e.g., Pix MED) conflicts with deterministic finality may require prefunding/escrow, tying up capital and pressuring RLDC as volumes scale. [[116]](#post-116)

#### **Timing**
- Near‑term (2025): management prioritizes activating significantly more corridors before year‑end; corridor metrics/rulebooks remain non‑public as of Aug 12. [[10]](#post-10) [[71]](#post-71) [[103]](#post-103)

#### **Dependencies**
  - Corridor capacity and transparency:
    - [Publish SLAs/metrics; ≥10 banked corridors live] [[64]](#post-64) [[71]](#post-71)
  - Local regulatory treatments and bank connectivity:
    - [Brazil/Mexico/Nigeria FX/PSP rules; payout partners] [[111]](#post-111) [[75]](#post-75)
  - Refund/return and liability frameworks:
    - [Public CPN rules for refund windows/escrow] [[97]](#post-97) [[103]](#post-103) [[116]](#post-116)

#### **Net Impact**
- Ambiguous to negative near term. Corridor dependency and non‑public SLAs/metrics constrain investor confidence in TPV ramp and unit economics; EM refund regimes may introduce capital drag. Mitigants include Circle’s authorizations and processor partnerships that could compress onboarding frictions. [[64]](#post-64) [[83]](#post-83)


### **Theme 5 — Adoption Drivers, User Trust & Macro Tailwinds**

#### **Scale**
- Strong adoption signals: USDC circulation ~$61.3–65.2bn; on‑chain volume up 5.4× YoY; “meaningful wallets” +68% YoY; 10% of supply on Circle’s platform—expanding first‑party monetization surfaces. [[23]](#post-23) [[45]](#post-45) [[90]](#post-90) [[92]](#post-92) [[91]](#post-91)
- Trust from “invisible crypto” UX and market‑neutral embeds (Fiserv/FIS/Matera/Shopify/Remitly/MoneyGram/exchanges) lowers cognitive and operational friction for first‑time users. [[66]](#post-66) [[84]](#post-84) [[99]](#post-99)
- Macro/regulatory tailwind: GENIUS‑era clarity plus EM inflation/capital‑control frictions drive “digital dollarization,” deepening USDC float and feeable velocity. [[85]](#post-85) [[102]](#post-102)

#### **Timing**
- Immediate catalyst post‑GENIUS/IPO: management reports a rapid rise in institutional engagement, with the caveat that large FI rollouts take time; CPN corridors are already live; Arc testnet expected fall 2025. [[31]](#post-31) [[32]](#post-32) [[75]](#post-75) [[23]](#post-23)

#### **Dependencies**
  - Publish corridor‑level consumer metrics and protections:
    - [Off‑ramp spreads, ETAs, failure rates; refund/recourse standards] [[66]](#post-66) [[71]](#post-71) [[99]](#post-99) [[109]](#post-109)
  - Corporate‑treasury pathways to yield:
    - [Regulator‑blessed USDC→USYC sweep frameworks; ECP gating] [[119]](#post-119) [[125]](#post-125)
  - Sustained partner distribution and 24/7 convertibility:
    - [Exchanges/processors; USYC↔USDC uptime/latency] [[23]](#post-23) [[62]](#post-62) [[72]](#post-72)

#### **Net Impact**
- Likely positive. Distribution depth plus UX abstraction and macro tailwinds support durable, non‑speculative flows. Sensitivities: consumer‑protection transparency, treasury yield pathways under the interest ban, and measured rollout pacing at large FIs. [[85]](#post-85) [[118]](#post-118) [[119]](#post-119)


### **Theme 6 — Technical Architecture & Network Governance Risks**

#### **Scale**
- Architecture choices (USDC‑as‑gas, vetted validators, opt‑in privacy, native FX) could enable institutional‑grade performance and fee monetization but risk centralization and regulatory reclassification (venue/payment‑system), increasing compliance opex and gating. [[23]](#post-23) [[61]](#post-61) [[69]](#post-69)
- If bounded/predictable fees rely on non‑price congestion controls (allowlists/identity quotas/scheduling), permissionless composability and developer network effects may erode. [[63]](#post-63)
- Validator obligations (KYC/AML/jurisdictions/capital) and U.S. retail access for FX are unspecified publicly; Travel‑Rule and local PSP/FX duties may extend to validators. [[106]](#post-106) [[94]](#post-94) [[112]](#post-112) [[65]](#post-65)

#### **Timing**
- Design specifics are pending testnet (fall 2025); no U.S./EU regulatory determination on Arc’s FX/perimeter as of Aug 12, 2025. [[23]](#post-23) [[76]](#post-76)

#### **Dependencies**
  - Publish fee algorithm, block limits, and congestion/spam controls:
    - [Clarity needed; falsifier: elastic pricing sans allowlists] [[81]](#post-81) [[113]](#post-113) [[63]](#post-63)
  - Validator admission/KYC blueprint and initial validator set:
    - [Criteria and count at mainnet] [[96]](#post-96) [[106]](#post-106) [[112]](#post-112)
  - U.S. access policy for FX:
    - [ECP‑only gating/geofencing; CFTC/NFA posture] [[87]](#post-87) [[94]](#post-94)

#### **Net Impact**
- Ambiguous. Institutional‑ready features and USDC‑denominated fees may simplify monetization within PPSI/MiCA perimeters, but centralization trade‑offs and venue/payment‑system exposure could add cost, require gating, and slow ecosystem growth until clarified. [[120]](#post-120) [[69]](#post-69) [[63]](#post-63)


## Cross-Theme Interaction Summary

✅ Theme 1 ↔ Theme 3 — Platform fee surfaces (Gateway/CPN/Arc gas) can offset reserve‑income sensitivity if they scale with rising USDC velocity. [[80]](#post-80) [[61]](#post-61) [[67]](#post-67)

✅ Theme 1 ↔ Theme 4 — CPN/Arc benefits depend on corridor execution (banked corridors, SLAs, refund rules); operational drag can blunt monetization. [[64]](#post-64) [[71]](#post-71) [[10]](#post-10)

✅ Theme 2 ↔ Theme 6 — Arc’s validator/FX design influences whether regulators treat it as a venue/payment system; perimeter outcomes will shape access, costs, and governance. [[69]](#post-69) [[76]](#post-76) [[112]](#post-112)

✅ Theme 2 ↔ Theme 5 — GENIUS/MiCA clarity supports mainstream adoption, but the interest ban may slow corporate‑treasury working‑cash unless compliant sweeps to USYC are enabled. [[102]](#post-102) [[118]](#post-118) [[119]](#post-119)

✅ Theme 3 ↔ Theme 5 — Macro “digital dollarization” and expanding distribution can lift USDC float/velocity, supporting usage‑linked revenues that buffer rate cuts. [[85]](#post-85) [[80]](#post-80)

✅ Theme 4 ↔ Theme 5 — Publishing corridor metrics and consumer‑protection standards can strengthen trust and adoption; opacity risks stall conversion. [[66]](#post-66) [[71]](#post-71) [[99]](#post-99)

✅ Theme 3 ↔ Theme 6 — If Arc cannibalizes high‑margin partner revenues and introduces venue/validator compliance costs, RLDC margin could face a dual squeeze. [[68]](#post-68) [[69]](#post-69) [[65]](#post-65)

✅ Theme 1 ↔ Theme 2 — Using USDC‑as‑gas avoids launching a new L1 token, aligning fees with PPSI/MiCA EMI perimeters and easing integration/legal friction. [[120]](#post-120) [[102]](#post-102)

✅ Theme 4 ↔ Theme 2 — Local FX/PSP/Travel‑Rule regimes (e.g., Brazil/Mexico/Nigeria) directly condition CPN corridor activation and scalability. [[111]](#post-111) [[65]](#post-65)

## Emerging Clusters & Factions

Five distinct clusters emerged, spanning optimism about a compounding adoption flywheel to caution over regulatory perimeter, architecture centralization, margin sensitivity, and corridor execution. The debate centered on whether Circle’s integrated stack (Arc, Gateway, CPN, USYC/USDC) plus GENIUS/MiCA tailwinds can shift revenue toward usage-linked fees fast enough while avoiding venue/licensing traps and EM operational frictions.

### Cluster 1: Adoption Flywheel Builders

- Market‑neutral distribution and UX abstraction (Gateway single‑balance; USDC‑as‑gas) reduce onboarding friction and increase trust, enabling volume‑linked fee capture as on‑chain velocity rises. [[82]](#post-82) [[95]](#post-95) [[80]](#post-80) [[84]](#post-84)
- Macro/regulatory tailwinds (GENIUS clarity; EM inflation/capital controls) drive “digital dollarization,” expanding USDC float and feeable velocity across CPN/Gateway/Arc. [[85]](#post-85) [[102]](#post-102) [[118]](#post-118) [[66]](#post-66)
- Key voices: Retail Crypto User Advocate – Crypto Payments Industry Operator – Global Macro Strategist

### Cluster 2: Perimeter & Licensing Guardians

- Arc’s native PvP FX and Circle‑vetted validators risk ATS/SEF (U.S.) or MTF/payment‑system (EU) treatment; FATF Travel Rule and PSP/FX obligations may extend to validators, requiring gating/geofencing and raising opex. [[69]](#post-69) [[87]](#post-87) [[65]](#post-65)
- National corridor regimes (Brazil/Mexico/Nigeria) impose FX/payment constraints; call for a published multi‑jurisdiction licensing/KYC blueprint and Arc U.S. access policy amid no specific regulator opinions yet. [[111]](#post-111) [[96]](#post-96) [[76]](#post-76)
- Key voices: Crypto Legal Counsel (Capital Markets) – Financial Regulator (Emerging Markets)

### Cluster 3: Architecture Centralization Skeptics

- Bounded/predictable Arc fees likely shift congestion control to non‑price mechanisms (allowlists/identity quotas/scheduling), concentrating discretion and eroding permissionless composability and developer network effects. [[63]](#post-63) [[81]](#post-81) [[113]](#post-113)
- Design opacity on fee algorithm, spam/DoS controls, validator admission/KYC/capital, and U.S. retail access fuels concern over centralization and perimeter creep. [[106]](#post-106) [[96]](#post-96) [[94]](#post-94) [[114]](#post-114)
- Key voices: Blockchain Infrastructure Lead – Independent Market Skeptic & Columnist

### Cluster 4: Margin & Rate‑Sensitivity Realists

- Earnings are highly rate‑dependent; a Fed easing cycle and sticky partner incentives could compress RLDC margin; other revenue must scale faster to offset. [[73]](#post-73) [[79]](#post-79) [[77]](#post-77) [[67]](#post-67)
- Arc could cannibalize high‑margin blockchain‑partnership fees; monetization lags velocity unless new fee surfaces ramp quickly. [[68]](#post-68) [[90]](#post-90) [[80]](#post-80)
- Key voices: Institutional Portfolio Manager – Independent Market Skeptic & Columnist

### Cluster 5: Corridor Execution & Consumer‑Trust Operators

- CPN scaling depends on licensed PSPs with 24/7 liquidity, onboarding capacity, and Travel Rule screening; push for public corridor‑level SLAs, FX spreads, settlement times, and failure/reversal rates. [[64]](#post-64) [[75]](#post-75) [[71]](#post-71) [[103]](#post-103) [[97]](#post-97)
- EM refund/chargeback regimes (e.g., Pix MED) clash with deterministic finality, implying prefunding/escrow drag; call for published consumer‑protection standards (refund/recourse, misdirected‑payment mitigation, fee caps). [[116]](#post-116) [[127]](#post-127) [[109]](#post-109) [[99]](#post-99)
- Key voices: Crypto Payments Industry Operator – Financial Regulator (Emerging Markets) – Retail Crypto User Advocate

### Analysis

#### Convergences
- Regulatory clarity (GENIUS/MiCA) is a structural adoption tailwind for USDC in payments/settlement. [[102]](#post-102) [[118]](#post-118)
- Gateway’s abstraction and USDC‑as‑gas meaningfully reduce onboarding friction; a single USDC pool improves treasury utility. [[82]](#post-82) [[95]](#post-95)
- Usage‑linked monetization must grow to buffer rate compression; first‑party fee surfaces (Gateway/CPN/Arc gas) are necessary. [[80]](#post-80) [[67]](#post-67)
- Corridor transparency (SLAs, spreads, ETAs, failure rates) and rule clarity are prerequisites for mainstream trust and underwriting. [[71]](#post-71) [[103]](#post-103) [[97]](#post-97)
- Arc specifics remain unsettled; no regulator has opined on its venue/payment‑system status as of the call. [[76]](#post-76)

#### Fault‑Lines
- Architecture openness vs. institutional control: predictable USDC fees with vetted validators vs. risk of non‑price congestion controls that centralize discretion. [[63]](#post-63) [[113]](#post-113) [[114]](#post-114)
- Perimeter exposure: Arc as potential ATS/SEF/MTF/payment system vs. belief that USDC‑as‑gas and PPSI/MiCA positioning mitigates token/venue risks. [[69]](#post-69) [[87]](#post-87) [[120]](#post-120) [[102]](#post-102)
- Unit economics: optimism that velocity‑tied fees will scale vs. concern that rate cuts, sticky incentives, and Arc cannibalization will squeeze RLDC. [[80]](#post-80) [[67]](#post-67) [[68]](#post-68)
- Corridor execution: partners/authorizations can compress onboarding (optimists) vs. realities of FX/capital‑control regimes, refund windows, and absent public SLAs (pragmatists/cautionaries). [[83]](#post-83) [[64]](#post-64) [[116]](#post-116) [[71]](#post-71)
- Corporate‑treasury yield: GENIUS’s interest ban as a headwind needing USYC sweeps vs. a clean two‑track (USDC cash/USYC yield) that eases institutional adoption. [[119]](#post-119) [[118]](#post-118)

## Top Reinforced Points & Network Propagation

### Trust Flywheel From Abstraction

> “Circle’s consumer trust flywheel is forming: CPN live in remittance-heavy corridors, Gateway hides chain complexity, and USDC-as-gas removes native-token hurdles—critical for first-time users entering via Fiserv/FIS/Shopify funnels. To lock-in mainstream adoption, publish corridor-level off-ramp spreads, median settlement times, and failure rates [Status: UNKNOWN]. | Falsifier: Off-ramp spreads widen; NPS/meaningful wallets stall {Conf: Med}” [[66]](#post-66)

- Reinforced by: Adoption Flywheel Builders; Corridor Execution & Consumer‑Trust Operators
- Endorsement Level: High (8×)
- Propagation Reason: Cross-theme relevance (UX, payments corridors, fee transparency) and actionable metrics request made it a rallying point for both product and compliance voices.
- Role in Discourse: Consensus base for “invisible crypto” plus execution benchmark (call for corridor metrics).

### ARC Fees Centralization Risk

> “If ARC targets bounded/predictable USDC fees, spam/DoS resistance likely shifts from price to non-price controls (identity quotas, allowlists, or centralized scheduling), concentrating discretion in vetted validators and reducing permissionless composability—eroding developer-driven network effects versus open L1s. [Status: UNKNOWN] on ARC congestion-control design. | Falsifier: Testnet shows elastic pricing sans allowlists {Conf: Med}” [[63]](#post-63)

- Reinforced by: Architecture Centralization Skeptics; Perimeter & Licensing Guardians
- Endorsement Level: High (8×)
- Propagation Reason: Quotable “bounded fees → non‑price controls” causality crystallized a complex design tradeoff, applicable to Arc’s tech and regulatory posture.
- Role in Discourse: Early warning and falsifiable testnet check for architecture openness.

### Reserve Income Sensitivity

> “Reserve-income sensitivity: a Fed easing cycle would compress short-end yields, reducing net reserve income even if USDC supply grows, while partner incentives to win share could keep RLDC margins tight; high‑margin ‘other revenue’ must scale faster to offset. | Falsifier: Short rates stable/rising or other revenue > guidance {Conf: Med}” [[67]](#post-67)

- Reinforced by: Margin & Rate‑Sensitivity Realists; Adoption Flywheel Builders
- Endorsement Level: High (8×)
- Propagation Reason: Direct linkage of macro rates to earnings and margin pressure made this a core underwriting frame; falsifiers offer clean monitoring.
- Role in Discourse: Risk baseline and capital‑allocation anchor.

### ARC FX Venue Risk

> “ARC’s “native FX engine” with Circle‑vetted validators may trigger trading‑venue/payment‑system obligations (EU MiFID II MTF/PSR; US ATS/SEF or designated payment system) because it enables centrally governed multilateral PVP price formation and settlement in USDC, giving Circle operator control and access rules. Licensing, capital, transparency, surveillance, and fair‑access could materially raise costs and slow onboarding. | Falsifier: Regulator opinion: ARC not multilateral matching/venue/payment system {Conf: Med}” [[69]](#post-69)

- Reinforced by: Perimeter & Licensing Guardians; Architecture Centralization Skeptics
- Endorsement Level: High (8×)
- Propagation Reason: Concrete naming of legal perimeters (ATS/SEF/MTF/PSR) focused the regulatory debate and set a clear need for opinions/no‑actions.
- Role in Discourse: Rebuttal anchor against unqualified Arc scalability assumptions.

### EM Refunds vs Finality

> “EM consumer‑protection rules (e.g., Brazil’s Pix MED) mandate post‑payment revocation/return windows that conflict with ARC’s deterministic finality; CPN members may need prefunding/escrow to honor refunds and FX reversals, tying up capital and pressuring RLDC as volumes scale. [Status: UNKNOWN] public CPN refund/liability rules. | Falsifier: Publish rulebook with refund windows/escrow {Conf: Med}” [[116]](#post-116)

- Reinforced by: Corridor Execution & Consumer‑Trust Operators; Margin & Rate‑Sensitivity Realists
- Endorsement Level: High (8×)
- Propagation Reason: Sharp operational‑finance linkage (refund rights → capital drag) resonated across payments ops and margin discussions.
- Role in Discourse: Execution checkpoint and unit‑economics caution.

### GENIUS Two‑Track Clarity

> “GENIUS Act codifies payment stablecoins as non‑securities and bans interest, creating a clean two‑track set: USDC as regulatory‑safe digital cash and USYC for yield/collateral. This reduces legal frictions for banks/brokers/treasurers, likely accelerating institutional onboarding and deepening USDC liquidity—supporting volume‑linked fees (Gateway/CPN/ARC) even if rates fall. | Falsifier: Final rules narrow carve‑out or curb USYC collateral use {Conf: Med}” [[118]](#post-118)

- Reinforced by: Adoption Flywheel Builders; Perimeter & Licensing Guardians
- Endorsement Level: High (8×)
- Propagation Reason: Memorable “two‑track” framing bridged legal clarity with monetization strategy, appealing to both legal and revenue audiences.
- Role in Discourse: Strategic framing for post‑GENIUS product positioning.

### Interest Ban Treasury Headwind

> “Genius Act’s ban on paying interest to stablecoin holders is a corporate‑treasury adoption headwind: enterprises expect yield on operational cash, but auto‑sweeping USDC into USYC likely requires segregated wallets, suitability/ECP gating, and retail exclusions—driving either lower USDC working balances (shrinking reserve income) or richer partner incentives to hold float, pressuring RLDC. [Status: UNKNOWN] on regulator‑blessed integrated auto‑sweeps. | Falsifier: ECP‑gated auto‑sweep approval + rising enterprise USDC balances {Conf: Med}” [[119]](#post-119)

- Reinforced by: Margin & Rate‑Sensitivity Realists; Perimeter & Licensing Guardians
- Endorsement Level: High (8×)
- Propagation Reason: Balanced, mechanics‑level view of treasury workflows and compliance gating turned a legal constraint into a tangible margin scenario.
- Role in Discourse: Counterweight to GENIUS optimism; design brief for compliant sweep solutions.

## Recommendations for Investment Professionals

Widely Supported
* Model reserve-income sensitivity explicitly – run ±100 bp scenarios using Circle’s disclosed ~$618m annualized swing per 100 bp; overlay 2025 RLDC margin guidance (36–38%) and “other revenue” guide ($75–85m) to test downside headroom if rates ease and incentives stay sticky. [[77]](#post-77) [[56]](#post-56) [[67]](#post-67)
* Require quarterly bridges tying on-chain USDC volume to monetized products before underwriting a rapid fee mix‑shift – ask for audited KPIs linking volume to Gateway/CPN/Arc/other revenue; flag if “other revenue” continues to lag velocity growth. [[86]](#post-86) [[80]](#post-80) [[90]](#post-90)
* Treat Arc gas‑revenue in models as contingent – wait for public testnet/docs confirming fee algorithm and congestion controls; only assign scale economics if elastic pricing is demonstrated without allowlists/identity quotas. [[63]](#post-63) [[81]](#post-81) [[113]](#post-113) [[114]](#post-114) [[29]](#post-29)
* Underwrite Arc FX economics only after perimeter clarity – request management’s U.S. access policy (ECP‑only/geofencing) and engage counsel on ATS/SEF (U.S.) and MTF/PSR (EU) risk; assume gating and higher opex until a regulator opinion/no‑action exists. [[69]](#post-69) [[87]](#post-87) [[94]](#post-94) [[76]](#post-76)
* Demand corridor‑level transparency before assigning aggressive CPN TPV ramps – obtain CPN Rules excerpts and corridor SLAs (latency/uptime), refund/liability workflows, standardized reason codes, plus corridor FX spreads/median settlement times/failure rates; treat current public claims as insufficient. [[103]](#post-103) [[97]](#post-97) [[71]](#post-71)
* Stress test USYC↔USDC operational performance – require measured latency/slippage/uptime or enterprise SLAs; use conservative assumptions (e.g., slippage >10 bps or latency >5s) until metrics are published or validated empirically. [[62]](#post-62) [[72]](#post-72)
* Haircut Brazil corridor economics until refund/escrow mechanics are disclosed – Pix MED’s post‑payment return windows can force blocking/returns; assume prefunding/escrow drag in CPN until Circle publishes refund/liability rules. [[116]](#post-116) [[127]](#post-127) [[103]](#post-103)
* Track corridor activation pace as a gating variable – anchor on four disclosed live corridors (HK, BR, NG, MX) and require evidence of ≥10 banked corridors with named partners and 24/7 liquidity before extrapolating fees. [[75]](#post-75) [[64]](#post-64)
* Use “on‑platform share” as a leading indicator of first‑party fee capture – monitor the percentage of USDC on Circle’s platform (≈10% at Q2) for progress on usage‑linked monetization. [[91]](#post-91) [[45]](#post-45)
* Watch partner‑incentive drag and blockchain‑partnership fee mix – track distribution/transaction costs vs RLDC margin and the durability of high‑margin partner fees (which added ~2.2pp in Q2) while Arc scales. [[45]](#post-45) [[79]](#post-79) [[68]](#post-68)
* Incorporate GENIUS/MiCA timelines into adoption assumptions – monitor U.S. implementing rules (due within 1 year; effective the earlier of 18 months post‑enactment or 120 days after final rules) and treat the Act’s interest ban as a structural constraint on “cash” yield. [[93]](#post-93) [[105]](#post-105) [[118]](#post-118)

Experimental / Watch‑list
* Arc cannibalization risk to “other revenue” – watch whether proprietary L1 economics displace high‑margin blockchain‑partnership fees as Arc launches; re‑weight quality of “other revenue” if mix shifts unfavorably. [[68]](#post-68)
* U.S. retail‑forex exposure – defer assigning retail FX volumes to Arc until U.S. access policy (ECP‑only) and any CFTC/NFA posture are clear; geofencing or RFED/FCM obligations would change opex and addressable market. [[87]](#post-87) [[88]](#post-88) [[94]](#post-94)
* EU PSD2/MiCA interplay for network fees – monitor EBA/MiCA guidance on EMT‑linked “gas” fees and potential PSP authorisation; assume added compliance friction until NCAs settle scope. [[124]](#post-124)
* National corridor regimes – treat BR/MX/NG expansion as policy‑dependent; monitor BACEN consultation outcomes, Mexico’s virtual‑asset restrictions, and Nigeria’s VASP banking rules for FX/payment licensing and reporting constraints. [[111]](#post-111)
* Enterprise integration friction – note absence of official NetSuite/SAP connectors; treat connector launches (or a published GAAP policy memo) as adoption catalysts that could shorten deal cycles. [[126]](#post-126) [[115]](#post-115)
* Remittance penetration evidence – avoid attributing country‑level share gains without audited corridor studies; request third‑party case studies quantifying % of inflows via USDC/CPN. [[107]](#post-107) [[100]](#post-100)
* Consumer‑protection proof points – ask for published standards (refund windows, misdirected‑payment mitigation, fee caps) and off‑ramp “fee + ETA” receipts; treat improvements in complaint rates/CSAT as trust signals. [[99]](#post-99) [[109]](#post-109) [[66]](#post-66)
* Arc performance claims – wait for testnet measurements to confirm Malachite/Tendermint‑derived deterministic finality (sub‑second) before baking throughput/finality into revenue timing. [[128]](#post-128)
* Fee schedule opacity – CPN and Arc fee schedules are not publicly posted; assume conservative net take‑rates until negotiated rates or APIs are shared. [[110]](#post-110)
* Nigeria partner clarity – seek definitive BFI/PSP mappings for NG corridor before extrapolating capacity; public partner lists are incomplete. [[75]](#post-75)
* Velocity–monetization gap – continue to benchmark “other revenue” growth against on‑chain volume growth; flag persistence of under‑capture as a thesis risk. [[80]](#post-80) [[90]](#post-90)

## Expert Network Questions

### **Profile 1 – U.S./EU Market‑Structure Counsel (ATS/SEF/MTF & payment‑system perimeter)** 
* For Arc’s native PvP FX, map the precise triggers that would classify it as a U.S. ATS/SEF versus a “designated payment system.” What functional elements (multilateral interaction, order types, matching, access rules) are decisive, and which design choices avoid the perimeter?
* In the EU, under MiFID II and PSR, which Arc features would tip it into MTF/payment‑system scope? How would you structure price formation, access, and operator discretion to remain outside MTF while preserving PvP settlement?
* If Arc must gate U.S. users to avoid retail‑forex exposure under CEA §2(c)(2)(C), what ECP‑only controls, attestations, and geofencing mechanics are sufficient in practice? Where have similar controls failed under CFTC/NFA scrutiny?
* For a PoA validator set running FX/PvP, when do validators become “obliged entities” (VASPs/PSPs)? What KYC, reporting, capital, and data‑localization burdens arise in Brazil, Mexico, and Nigeria, and who holds primary liability (operator vs validators vs corridor PSPs)?
* Charging network fees in USDC: under MiCA/PSD2/PSR, what additional EU permissions (if any) are typically required beyond EMI? How should fee disclosure be drafted to satisfy white‑paper/consumer‑fee obligations given variable “gas”?
* If Arc is treated as a venue, outline a minimally compliant model (surveillance, fair‑access, transparency, rulebook governance) that preserves institutional UX while containing opex. What is the pragmatic licensing sequence (U.S. first vs EU first)?
* What documentation would you expect from Circle to defend a “not a multilateral trading venue/payment system” stance (e.g., legal opinions, access/rule artifacts, operator‑function matrices)? What are the most persuasive precedents?
* Given GENIUS timelines, what is the optimal regulator‑engagement strategy (agencies, no‑action targets, consultation windows) to de‑risk Arc FX before mainnet?

### **Profile 2 – EM Payments Operations Executive (Brazil/Mexico/Nigeria corridors & refund regimes)**
* What corridor‑level payout SLAs (median, P95 latency; uptime) are considered bank‑grade for Pix/SPEI/mobile wallets? Which monitoring and redundancy patterns consistently hit those targets 24/7?
* How should CPN members operationalize Pix MED refund/revocation against deterministic finality? What reserve/prefunding or escrow levels (as % of corridor TPV) and hold times are practical to contain reversal risk without choking liquidity?
* For SPEI/Mexico, what return/reversal and cutoff realities matter most for near‑instant USDC→MXN payouts? How do successful operators avoid weekend/holiday liquidity gaps?
* Nigeria: given current VASP banking guidelines and settlement restrictions, what workable flow design supports USDC off‑ramps while minimizing T+3 and cash‑handling risks? Which controls most reduce bank pushback?
* Travel Rule execution at scale: which interop approach (e.g., trusted network, verifiable credentials) has proven operationally reliable across BFIs/OFIs in these corridors? How do you meet data‑localization demands without breaking TPV?
* Liquidity provisioning: what desk structure and hedging toolkit keep USDC↔BRL/MXN/NGN spreads tight 24/7 under capital controls? Which triggers should auto‑widen spreads or pause routing to avoid loss‑making corridors?
* Onboarding throughput: with bank/PSP diligence and technical certification, how many net‑new corridors per quarter are realistically achievable? What self‑service tooling most accelerates partner activation without raising fail rates?
* Consumer trust: what “fee + ETA receipt,” reason‑code taxonomy, and refund/return commitments demonstrably lift conversion and reduce support tickets in these corridors?

### **Profile 3 – Exchange Collateral & Treasury Architect (USYC collateral, liquidity & enterprise treasury)**
* For using USYC as cross‑margin collateral with USDC as settlement cash, what max tolerable USYC→USDC conversion latency and slippage thresholds keep liquidation/top‑up risk negligible (base vs stress)? What SLOs do you demand contractually?
* How do you structure haircuts and eligibility grids for yield‑bearing collateral amid rate‑cut scenarios? What stress tests (yield drop, depeg rumors, chain congestion) materially change haircuts or concentration limits?
* Off‑exchange triparty collateral: what segregation, recall, and substitution mechanics are required to ensure 24/7 collateral mobility without funding‑rate penalties? Which failure modes should be pre‑negotiated in playbooks?
* Quantify financing‑cost compression from “hold USYC, spend USDC”: walk through the net cost stack (on‑token yield, conversion frictions, basis/funding differentials) and sensitivity to short‑rate shifts and latency spikes.
* What telemetry do you instrument to detect convertibility degradation in real time (latency, slippage, queue depth) and trigger auto‑routing/fallbacks (e.g., T+0/T+1 redemption channels) before margin risk accumulates?
* Under the GENIUS interest ban, how would you design an enterprise auto‑sweep from USDC into USYC that passes legal, compliance, and audit scrutiny (ECP gating, suitability, controls)? What governance and reporting do auditors expect?
* For treasury ops, how do you practically eliminate native‑token inventories using USDC‑denominated gas and Gateway‑style abstractions? What KPIs prove reduced ops float and reconciliation overhead to CFOs?
* Pricing strategy: how would you pass through Gateway/CPN/Arc network fees to institutional clients (cost‑plus vs tiered) while preserving adoption? What guardrails prevent fee opacity from eroding trust?

[1] **Tiffany, Conference Operator** Tiffany, Conference Operator: Hello, and thank you for standing by. My name is Tiffany, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Circle Internet Group Q2 twenty twenty five Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to John Andrews, Vice President of Capital Markets and Investor Relations. John, please go ahead.

<a id="post-2"></a>
[2] **Joseph Vafi, Analyst, Canaccord** Joseph Vafi, Analyst, Canaccord: Great. Thanks, Jeremy. And then just on the USYC theme, maybe drill down a little bit on that expanded relationship there with finance with a focus on USYC and maybe just a little color on expanding that into USYC and not just USB? Thanks a lot.

<a id="post-3"></a>
[3] **Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle** Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle: Sure. A couple of things of note. So as noted in my comments, we have expanded our partnership with Binance. That includes both around USDC and USYC. With USDC, they’re continuing to adopt Circle Wallet technologies. They’re more they’re they’re sort of deeper support and integration with Circle’s wallet technology, which is going to help promote and grow the use of USDC on their platform. And so they’ve been a great partner and they’re leaning into both the technology and really driving USDC growth. The partnership around USYC is really important. When we acquired the product and then very recently relaunched the product, we designed it to be something that could be used as a yield bearing collateral instrument. And when you look at global exchanges today and Binance is the largest global exchange, there’s an enormous amount of collateral posted in those markets. And we believe that as institutionalization takes hold, that the big trading firms, asset managers, institutions are going to want to post yield bearing collateral, but then actually trade with USDC. And so the integration between USYC as yield bearing collateral and USDC as digital cash that can be used as a relative margin and in spot markets and the like. It’s a powerful market structure. The fact that we’re doing this with the biggest exchange in the world is really significant and we hope and expect that we will deploy this kind of architecture in more digital asset exchanges and ultimately on major traditional clearinghouses. Earlier in the year, we announced a collaboration with ICE And within the context of that, the goal is to stand up the ability to support yield bearing collateral like USYC, USDC as cash and settlement. And so, this new twenty fourseventhree sixty five market structure where you can seamlessly move between tokenized yield bearing collateral and cash, we think it’s the future of financial markets. And we’re obviously excited about pioneering an implementation of that vision with the largest digital asset exchange in the world.

[4] **Joseph Vafi, Analyst, Canaccord** Joseph Vafi, Analyst, Canaccord: Great. Congratulations again, Terry.

[5] **Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle** Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle: Thank you.

<a id="post-6"></a>
[6] **Tiffany, Conference Operator** Tiffany, Conference Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Pete Christiansen with Citi. Please go ahead.

<a id="post-7"></a>
[7] **Pete Christiansen, Analyst, Citi** Pete Christiansen, Analyst, Citi: Good morning. Thank you. And certainly, we echo our congratulations on a very, very successful IPO. It’s been a long road for you guys, so congratulations. Jeremy, I wanted to ask, and we get this question quite a bit from investors, is trying to understand, the transaction volume versus the circulation. Obviously, transaction volume growing way faster. So the question kind of comes down to, trying to understand the velocity of each token and how that relates to circulation overall. Just if you could dimensionalize that for us to help us better understand that relationship would be super helpful. Thank you.

<a id="post-8"></a>
[8] **Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle** Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle: Yeah, you’re welcome. Thanks again. A couple of things of note. I think obviously, you’re absolutely correct. The money stock, which today is sitting at around $55,600,000,000 of USDC versus the amount of transactional volume that happens on chain. That’s, by the way, not including transactions that are happening on exchanges, is sort of off chain transaction volume, but the on chain transaction volume. What you note is that a dollar digital currency such as USDC has very high velocity. And I think in part that is based on the fact that blockchain based transactions now, through the development of mature blockchain networks, allow transactions to happen in fractions of a second and fractions of a cent. And so the speed with which transactions can happen, the ability to move the digital dollars all around the world seamlessly, to move them between different protocols for investment or for payments, it is a higher velocity form of money. And I think just like data moves a lot faster than your newspaper delivery or your video call moves a lot faster than a letter, internet native architectures for velocity money overall. Now, in terms of the connection between that money velocity and core Stablecoin money supply, I think there’s correlation. You can sort of see that correlation. But we’ve also seen that over the last year, transaction volume growth has been higher than the stablecoin money supply growth. And I think in part that reflects the improvements in blockchain technology infrastructure so that it is faster and cheaper and easier to move these digital dollars around. And that also I think reflects the growth in payment utility that we’re seeing for these in emerging and developing markets and peer to peer transactions. And so, think it’s a mixture of things like that, that we look at. And I think from a very long term perspective, we certainly are interested kind of the monetary theory that will go behind this new internet financial system and money velocity and ultimately how we think about kind of macro aggregates in terms of impact on economic activity as a whole, but that’s a ways off.

<a id="post-9"></a>
[9] **Pete Christiansen, Analyst, Citi** Pete Christiansen, Analyst, Citi: That’s helpful. And then as my follow-up, I’m curious, CPM seems to be off to a great start here, a ton of new partnerships that you signed up, some marquee ones, in fact. Curious what’s the next milestones for CPN as you’re looking for that network to grow? And what is the interrelationship, I guess, between that you envision between CPN and ARC, in the future? Thank you.

<a id="post-10"></a>
[10] **Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle** Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle: Sure. It’s a great question. So we’re very happy with the initial launch of CPN. We we launched it, as you know, just very recently in what we consider to be the pilot phase. We’ve had a tremendous amount of demand from financial institutions that want to become members and want to participate on CPN. Really, the first phase has been about getting a few key high priority corridors active on that. So we’ve been able to bring four corridors, Hong Kong, Brazil, Nigeria, Mexico on. And as we look at the priorities for ourselves between now and the end of the year, let’s just say, we want to bring significantly more corridors on so that money flows can work seamlessly across major developed markets and more emerging and developing markets. And so that’s a big focus and making sure that we can provide sufficient liquidity across those corridors so that people who want to move volume through this can. So really activation of corridors is key. There are a lot of product features that we are developing in response to what the market has told us they need. And so one of the things that we found is that the number of institutions that want to onboard and become integrated and activate on the network sort of outstrips our capacity to bring them on. And so, we’re making self-service product dashboards, self-service tools for kind of configuring the way flows work for these institutions. And so that is key those key product investments and we hope to bring significant number of new members on. And obviously, ultimate ambition is that thousands of members will join CPN and participate in a wide array of payment flows. On the second follow-up question related to ARC, we do see ARK playing a very important role with CPN. ARK is designed to be a purpose built blockchain for stablecoin finance for payments, FX, and capital markets. And you will see in the light paper that was made available on our website just shortly ago that ARC itself will include a native FX engine and FX platform within it. ARC will include configurable privacy and and opt in confidential transfer transfers, very important features for money flows between financial institutions. And then obviously a straightforward kind of security and gas fee model. All of those are attractive for what we’re building for ARC, and we certainly hope that many of the financial institutions that are implementing and integrating with ARC will use, our CPM, excuse me, will use ARC network as a as a key kind of backplane for, you know, their their payments and financial obligations.

[12] **John Andrews, VP of Capital Markets and Investor Relations, Circle** John Andrews, VP of Capital Markets and Investor Relations, Circle: Good morning and welcome. This is John Andrews, VP of Capital Markets and Investor Relations at Circle, and I’d like to welcome you to our second quarter twenty twenty five earnings conference call. We are excited for all of you who have joined us this morning as we take another key step on our journey as public company with our first earnings call. I’m joined by Jeremy Allaire, our Co Founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman and Jeremy Foxkeen, our Chief Financial Officer. Earlier this morning, we posted our earnings press release and earnings presentation on the Circle Investor Relations website, investor.circle.com. A transcript of this call will be posted on that website once available. I do need to remind everyone that our earnings release, presentation and this call contain statements that are forward looking. Because forward looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and some of which are beyond our control, we should not rely on these forward looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results could differ materially from those projected in that forward looking statement. Information concerning risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause these results to differ is included in our SEC filings. We will also disclose non GAAP financial measures in the call today. Definitions of those non GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the earnings release and earnings presentation that are available on our Investor Relations website at investor.circle.com. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for GAAP measures. With that out of the way, it’s with pleasure. Let me turn it over to Jeremy Allaire.

<a id="post-13"></a>
[13] **Tiffany, Conference Operator** Tiffany, Conference Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

<a id="post-14"></a>
[14] **Ken Worthington, Analyst, JPMorgan** Ken Worthington, Analyst, JPMorgan: Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on payments. The payment opportunity seems to be developing quickly. You guys launched CPN and Coinbase announced Shopify and building on the Coinbase Commerce platform. To what extent are these networks sort of complementary versus competing? And ultimately, is it important for Circle to be the dominant payment network? Or is it better to be sort of one of many networks as long as they’re sort of focused on in utilizing USDC?

<a id="post-15"></a>
[15] **Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle** Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle: Thanks, Ken. It’s a great question. There are a few pieces to this. So first and foremost, USDC as a stablecoin network is a market neutral infrastructure, which many, many different types of companies are building on top of, whether those are capital markets firms, trading firms, exchanges, brokerage platforms, neo banks, traditional banks, payment service providers. There’s a huge array of companies, networks themselves like Visa, Mastercard increasing their use of stablecoins and USDC specifically as well. So we expect many different payment networks and many different capital markets exchanges and others to build on our stablecoin market infrastructure. We view that as very valuable in growing use cases, very valuable in growing distribution. It can be very valuable in growing the adoption of other technology, protocols and services that we also monetize. And so broadly, we’ve got a big tent mentality here and we want to see a lot of success across many different types of companies. Now, I think secondly, when a Shopify launches USDC payment acceptance and they’re using a product from Coinbase to do that, that’s great. That’s exactly what we want to see from our partners like Coinbase and others. We want to see people building and integrating USDC into commerce flows and into other types of applications. And so as Shopify merchants can accept USDC, that grows the utility of the stablecoin network. That means that digital wallets that are in the hands of the hundreds of millions of Binance users or the 100,000,000 NewBank users or users who use different digital wallet products all around the world that support USDC, that they now have something that they can do with that and transact with that. So that grows network value for Circle and it expands the utility. That’s part of our competitive moat, is this expanding utility to developers that integrate this and deploy this in different ways. I would also say, just as a kind of comment, just in general, we are seeing incredible demand and acceleration from firms in the payments industry, from firms that build infrastructure for supporting payments with a wide variety of companies. Just in recent weeks, we’ve announced partnerships with Fiserv, FIS, CorePay, Matera. And these are firms that provide core infrastructure, including payment infrastructure, to tens of thousands of banks and financial institutions, and they’re integrating our technology. They’re integrating USDC, and that’s really tremendous and I think just represents that there are going be many, many different networks and many, many different distribution points for how this comes into payments. Obviously, CPN is a very important initiative from us and we want that to be a very, very successful general purpose on chain payments network. We believe that the model we’re putting forward with CPN is going to be very attractive to financial institutions and ultimately to the customers that they serve.

<a id="post-16"></a>
[16] **Ken Worthington, Analyst, JPMorgan** Ken Worthington, Analyst, JPMorgan: Okay. Amazing. Thank you. And then the Circle IPO, obviously a huge success here. You now have a really valuable currency. What are your thoughts on leveraging the value in your stock to drive additional shareholder value, through various means?

<a id="post-17"></a>
[17] **John Todaro, Analyst, Needham** John Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Is there an opportunity there? Yeah.

<a id="post-18"></a>
[18] **Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle** Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle: I can comment on that. I think, first and foremost, virtually everything that we do has overwhelmingly been the result of organic product development. We are a technology company. We’re a software driven technology company. And we like to build, we like to innovate. But we certainly, from time to time, find teams, find intellectual property, find complementary technology that we do want to add to the portfolio. And in fact, this morning alongside the announcement of ARK, we announced a small acquisition of both a team and intellectual property that is very important intellectual property in this next generation of stablecoin finance blockchains. So, that’s an example where we have done that. And earlier this year, we acquired another firm that had a team and core intellectual property around privacy and confidentiality in blockchains. And so we do see opportunities to use our currency to do M and A. But we’re careful and deliberate, I don’t think our strategy here is to go try and do big complex acquisitions to kind of throw kind of additional business lines next to what we do. I think we take a kind of full stack integrated platform view of what we do. And so we only want to do things that really fit clearly in that kind of product mandate. We’ve got a lot of organic development happening now and we’re excited to deliver on that.

<a id="post-19"></a>
[19] **Ken Worthington, Analyst, JPMorgan** Ken Worthington, Analyst, JPMorgan: Great. Thank you so much.

<a id="post-20"></a>
[20] **Tiffany, Conference Operator** Tiffany, Conference Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.

<a id="post-21"></a>
[21] **Owen Lau, Analyst, Oppenheimer** Owen Lau, Analyst, Oppenheimer: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. So first of all, congrats on the quarter and congrats on the successful IPO. For my question, could you please talk about the adoption of USDC in remittance? I know you have some partnerships with remittance companies, but some other are thinking about creating their own stablecoin as well. How do you gauge the adoption here? Is there any way you can quantify for us the penetration for USB C so far? Thanks a lot.

<a id="post-22"></a>
[22] **Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle** Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle: Yes, it’s a great question. We certainly have continued to see demand in remittance. And by the way, remittance that we observe is both kind of family member to family member or kind of individuals, but there’s a lot of B2B remittance, meaning companies that may have overseas operations and need to remit capital back to say The United States or Asia or Europe and so which is more like a treasury flow. But those kinds of cross border flows we’re seeing proliferate. We have more and more partnerships that are coming online in this use case. We obviously in the quarter had several prominent cross border fintechs expanding what they’re doing with USDC, Remitly, MoneyGram, ZEPS as well, all of whom have sizable franchises. And CPN itself, the primary use case on it is remittances, both consumer to consumer and B2B. And so, we’re seeing that as the first major use case on Circle Payments network as well. I would also say there are indirect things that we look at. So, for example, kind of peer to peer flows in different markets around the world. We kind of try and monitor those peer to peer flows through various websites that provide data on that. And we’ve grown our presence in those peer to peer flows fairly considerably over the last year. In terms of the general question of other stablecoins, I mean, I think the key thing to understand is that what makes a stablecoin network good for remittance is the liquidity of that stablecoin all around the world. And so what we’ve been able to do both through primary and secondary liquidity is create a tremendous liquidity network. And what does that mean? That means that if I have USDC and I send it to a person in Brazil, it’s fast and cheap to get that into a Brazilian bank account in real. And all around the world, there are these on and off ramp companies that support USDC. So, we’ve built the liquidity network which eases the way in which people can seamlessly move value and move value in and out of different currencies, e money systems, and banking systems. And so that liquidity network, which has been many, many years of work with regional banks, global banks, payment service providers, and others, is really something that is very, very difficult to replicate. So just having a coin doesn’t actually really solve a problem in terms of the ultimate delivery of money and the settlement of money and the liquidity of that against all of these different parts of the global financial system.

<a id="post-23"></a>
[23] **Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle** Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle: Thank you, John. I’m pleased to be here this morning. It’s been an honor to bring Circle public and host our first earnings call. We are thrilled to work with so many world class people, partners and investors. We started this company twelve years ago with an ambitious mission to build a new Internet financial system with blockchains and digital currency that could increase global economic prosperity through the frictionless exchange of value. We and the entire market are in the early stages of that vision, literally graduating from the early adopter phase of block chain technology and digital currency into the mainstream adoption phase that is accelerating. I want to start with some key highlights from 2025. USDC, the core of our stablecoin network, has grown to $61,300,000,000 at June 30, and growth has accelerated into Q3 to sixty five point two billion dollars in circulation as of August 10, representing approximately 90% year over year growth and 49% growth year to date, making USDC the fastest growing major stablecoin over the past year. In Q2, USDC on chain transaction volume grew 5.4x year over year to nearly $6,000,000,000,000 Our transaction volumes have also accelerated into Q3 with $2,400,000,000,000 in transactions in July alone. We have been rapidly expanding Circle’s platform and network with major new products, including Circle Payments Network, which we believe will become a breakthrough in global money movement by building an on chain native payments network that will move money faster and more efficiently and opens up new utility through programmable payments Circle Gateway, which enables seamless cross chain USDC experiences eight new blockchain partners and ARC, our new Layer one blockchain network, which we are announcing today. More on that later. Post IPO and Genius Act, we are experiencing rapid expansion in commercial opportunities with major mainstream companies across every sector of finance and technology, including companies from all around the world. And from a corporate mission perspective, we joined Pledge 1%, a global movement for corporate impact. To honor this commitment, prior to the IPO, we reserved 2,700,000.0 shares of our Class A common stock for future donations to our Circle Foundation. As we look at the overall stablecoin market, we believe that the total addressable market for stablecoins and our products is massive, with dollar stablecoins only representing a mere 1% of The U. S. M2 money supply, but with continued rapid growth in stablecoin supply. Today, Circle operates the largest regulated stablecoin network in the world. We talk about this a lot. Stablecoins are network businesses and have meaningful network effects. Growth of our Stablecoin network is driven by our platform, our blockchain protocols, and the developers building applications and services on our network. That expands the Circle on chain ecosystem and is the classic flywheel that has driven the growth of our Stablecoin network since its launch in 2018. Like other Internet platforms and network businesses, stablecoins are a winner take most market as liquidity and utility complement each other and drive growth. There have been many regulated and unregulated dollar stablecoins and many more to come, but the strength and resiliency of Circle’s network effects positions us well to compete and grow. Turning to the regulatory environment, Circle’s market and competitive strength is further cemented with the signing of the Genius Act, creating powerful tailwinds for Circle. We believe this law will accelerate stablecoin adoption by major financial institutions, mainstream enterprises, technology companies, and ultimately drive much broader use of stablecoins across retail and wholesale payments as well as broader usage in trad fi capital markets. This is likely the catalytic moment for the mainstream scaling of stablecoins, and we are already seeing this in our business momentum. Turning to our products and platform. We are continuing to make progress with our core digital asset products USDC, EURC and USYC. With USDC, we expanded our distribution onto eight new blockchain networks in 2025 and significantly expanded CCTP version two availability, both of which continue to cement USDC as the most liquid and available on chain dollar stablecoin. We also now offer a yield token, USYC, that can be used in both digital asset and traditional capital markets as collateral with twenty fourseventhree sixty five liquidity between USYC and USDC. We’re now executing that strategy, driven by our expanded partnership with Binance, who will now make USYC available as collateral, unlocking a very powerful use of USYC on the largest exchange in the world, and we’re already seeing accelerating adoption there. We’ve continued to expand our core banking and liquidity capabilities, including with multiple GSIBs, strengthening our unrivaled industry position. During Q2, we undertook the launch of one of the most ambitious new product investments, Circle Payments Network, our initiative to transform international money movement, which today already has active payment corridors in Hong Kong, Brazil, Nigeria and Mexico. We have rapidly grown our pipeline of financial institutions interested in launching on CPN to over 100 firms. We have an ambitious roadmap and will continue to expand CPN’s features and use cases from international money movement to other types of payments such as consumer and B2B payments and still further into global capital markets and corporate treasury services. We’re incredibly excited to see this level of interest so soon after CPM’s launch. In July, we introduced Circle Gateway, which abstracts away the complexity of holding USDC on different blockchains and in different wallets, streamlining usability and speeding transactions that use USDC. This is a key building block in bringing USDC into more mainstream financial and payment applications and creates new monetization opportunities for Circle. Now, I’d like to turn to a very special and major new platform initiative that we are announcing today, Arc. Arc is a new blockchain network from Circle that we will launch in the second half of the year. We are at the fulcrum of a massive mainstream embrace of stablecoins in the financial system, and firms are racing to build on this infrastructure. But until now, the blockchain infrastructure needed to meet the most intense demands of major financial firms and enterprises has simply not existed. We are delivering that infrastructure with Arc. Arc is a new Layer one blockchain that is compatible with Ethereum infrastructure but operates as a standalone network. Some key facts about ARK. We wanted to create a way for institutions to pay fees on blockchains in a fast, predictable manner that would be simple from an accounting perspective and could deliver very low cost and stable fees. So with ARK, we are using USDC itself as the native gas fee currency. This removes the complexity of paying transaction fees in a native token. ARC offers enterprise grade performance and real settlement finality. Financial institutions and regulators expect deterministic finality, which ARC will achieve with Circle vetted professional validators and its novel consensus mechanism. ARC will also offer configurable privacy controls with opt in confidential transfer features, which is essential for real world business and financial applications, and also supports regulatory compliance. And finally, ARC will be integrated across Circle’s entire product portfolio and will also provide best in class USDC liquidity and interoperability across the wide range of blockchain networks we already support. We are very excited about ARC and have shared more information, including a brief paper and platform details, on circle dot com and the ARC website. Now let’s turn to growth and adoption. Just in the past few months, we’ve seen incredible engagement and interest in working with Circle from major firms in every sector of the financial system, as well as Internet and technology companies, and this is consistent and accelerating all around the world. I’d like to highlight a few examples from our recent periods. In digital assets, we’ve launched and expanded key partnerships with Binance and OKX, two of the largest exchanges in the world. With Binance, we’ve significantly expanded our partnership to include broader use of Circle technology. We’re also continuing to see strong traction and partnerships in DeFi, including our planned launch of USDC on Hyperliquid, one of the fastest growing on chain exchanges and ecosystems. Major cross border payment firms like Remitly, MoneyGram and Zeps are integrating USDC into their payment networks, and Stripe made USDC central to its new global stablecoin financial accounts for businesses. Visa, Mastercard and others have publicly announced new products and plans that would expand availability and usage of USDC on their networks. I’m particularly excited that banking and payments infrastructure providers like Matera, Fiserv, FIS and CorePay all announced deals with Circle to add stablecoin capabilities and our technology into their product infrastructure that combined serves tens of thousands of banks and financial institutions. Now turning to digital asset trading markets, which continue to remain a key priority and a significant growth opportunity for Circle. Since we launched initiatives to drive USDC in the digital asset markets in early twenty twenty four, our share of spot trading volume has grown from 1% to 10% in Q2. And through our partnerships and growth initiatives, we are highly focused on continued market share gains. Digital asset firms globally are focused on working with the most trusted and compliant leader in stablecoins. To summarize, let me reiterate the advantages of our stablecoin network. Circle is uniquely positioned to lead in the mainstream adoption of blockchain and Stablecoins. Our platform powers developers, enterprises and institutions to build on the Circle Stablecoin network, leveraging our deep liquidity infrastructure and seamless global bank connectivity. We provide primary liquidity in every major financial center and have facilitated over $1,000,000,000,000 in USDC issuance and redemption since 2018. With Internet scale distribution across wallets, payment providers, banks and exchanges worldwide, Circle is becoming the default choice for institutions selecting stablecoin network. Our market neutral model invites broad adoption of our platform from even the most competitive players. Our trusted regulated status and long standing policy engagement capped by the passage of the Genius Act fortifies our position as the industry’s most reliable foundation. Together, these strengths create powerful competitive bulwarks and network effects that compound, driving exponential growth for Circle.

[24] **Owen Lau, Analyst, Oppenheimer** Owen Lau, Analyst, Oppenheimer: Got it. That’s very helpful. And then as my follow-up, could you please add more color on your partnership with OKX, which is a very large exchange in Asia as well? What is the economic arrangement look like? And how does this deal different from other deals such as Binance and Coinbase? Thanks a lot.

<a id="post-25"></a>
[25] **Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle** Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle: Sure. So first thing I’d say is digital asset markets are a critical market for us. They continue to grow. They’re very sizable. There are many companies, both regional companies and global companies that are critical there. We have been growing our participation in those markets fairly materially. Our share of spot market volume on the major exchanges grew tenfold over the last since beginning of 2024. And so we’re really focused on that. I think as kind of compliance and regulatory integration and having trustworthy, safe, stablecoins becomes more important, we’re finding more opportunities to partner with the biggest exchanges. Now, Coinbase had a head start. They were the first big exchange to really bet on USDC and that’s been great for them. Obviously, we established a partnership with Binance. We’ve expanded that partnership with Binance and they’re the largest exchange in the world. And with OKX, getting back to your question, we’re very excited about the expansion of our relationship with OKX. We don’t disclose the material or commercial terms of the specific transaction. But what we’ve characterized is that they’re adopting Circle Wallet technology we’re offering them integration into our core Circle Mint infrastructure so that they can provide the institutions that are coming to their platform with the best possible liquidity experience with USDC. And so they have 60,000,000 users. This is gonna help promote USDC to those 60,000,000 users, growing again the value and reach of our network and the utility of USDC. And we hope to do a lot more with OKX as they also become a much more regulated player, regulated in Europe. They obviously have publicly talked about their launch in The United States. And so it’s a very solid firm with a global franchise and an important expansion of our strategy in digital asset markets.

[26] **Owen Lau, Analyst, Oppenheimer** Owen Lau, Analyst, Oppenheimer: Thanks a lot.

<a id="post-27"></a>
[27] **Tiffany, Conference Operator** Tiffany, Conference Operator: Your next question comes from the line of John Todaro with Needham. Please go ahead.

<a id="post-28"></a>
[28] **John Todaro, Analyst, Needham** John Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter and the rollout of ARC. First question related to ARC, You know, how distributed is the goal for ARC from kind of a node operator, validator standpoint? How do you ensure gas fees remain low? And then I have a follow-up question.

<a id="post-29"></a>
[29] **Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle** Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle: Sure. Absolutely. A couple of things. One is I would highly encourage you to read the light paper which was made available this morning. And we talk a little bit about some of these issues there. So there is a novel fee mechanism that we have designed for ARC, which will ensure predictable low costs for transactions and obviously those transactions priced in USDC. I believe there’ll be subsequently significantly more information about the fee market mechanics as we go into kind of public test net. But there’s a novel approach that we’re taking there. It’s very important if you’re a financial institution or a commerce firm that you have low and predictable fees and fees that you can pay in real digital cash. And so that’s very important. And then in terms of distribution, I think we ultimately aspire that ARC is operated by a fairly large distributed network of professional validators. We are very focused on vetted professional validators that can meet the operational security and compliance expectations for people running this critical infrastructure. We want that to be highly geographically distributed. We want that to be distributed across major institutions as well. And so, I think we ultimately believe that this is a tremendous opportunity for financial market utilities, for financial institutions, for large existing major firms in validator infrastructure. And so we have a whole vision go to market that we’re thinking about there. And again, we’re in the early stages of standing this up, but that I think the light paper touches on this issue as well in terms of how we’re thinking about that evolution.

<a id="post-30"></a>
[30] **John Todaro, Analyst, Needham** John Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Great. Thanks for that Jeremy. And then just as it relates to Genius, so if you look into some of the Tether circulating supply growth seems to have kind of done this leveling off since July 27. USDC has continued to have growth since then. When you talked earlier about seeing some of that momentum or effects from Genius Act, was that sort of what you’re hinting at? Do you think that’s a result of Genius? Or we’re not really seeing the effects yet from that standpoint?

<a id="post-31"></a>
[31] **Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle** Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle: Yeah. I mean, it’s hard to specifically correlate the kind of the rapid acceleration in USTC growth over the past month and a half or so with a specific legislative outcome. I think one could broadly say awareness of USDC is growing around the world, awareness of USDC as a product that is sort of purpose built for what the Genius Act represents is interesting and whether that’s affecting user preference, it’s very, very hard to know. But my comment, I think that you’re referring to is much more around commercial engagement. Since the Circle IPO and since the final passage of Genius Act into law, we have seen just an incredible amount of inbound interest from financial institutions across every sector of the financial industry, from major technology companies, from large enterprises, and we’re seeing that interest coming into us from all around the world in all the geographies that we’re in. And so I think this has been a catalytic moment for mainstream institutions to say, Okay, now I can play. Now I can build. Now I can work with this technology. There’s obviously also been regulatory relief in The United States for financial institutions to engage in the space, and that’s obviously been additive as well. And so we’re just seeing the kind of commercial opportunity set that’s coming in for us right now growing considerably, which is really exciting. And I think that this is very much something that we talked about while we were going through our IPO and engaging with the market, which is that we believed that Genius Act would be an important catalytic moment and a tailwind to adoption of what we’re doing. And now we’ve got to kind of grab those opportunities and make sure we’re building the right products and services for these partners and critically make sure we can put together win win economic relationships where these customers can deliver value for their customers, they can grow economically, we can grow economically, and that’s very much our fundamental philosophy as we partner with firms around the world.

<a id="post-32"></a>
[32] **Jeremy Fox-Gein, Chief Financial Officer, Circle** Jeremy Fox-Gein, Chief Financial Officer, Circle: Just add on to that. Genius has clearly been a major catalytic event from that interest from major financial institutions across every segment of financial activity. I’d make one sort of cautionary note though, while absolutely necessary for this accelerating growth in USDC and in the Internet financial system, financial services companies, particularly the largest ones integrating with new technologies and rolling that out to their customers typically takes time. And what’s tremendous about where we sit is they’re exploring deep integrations with us, which leads to stickiness over time. But at the same time, the speed of their rollout will be dependent upon them and their own abilities internally to make progress. That’s

<a id="post-33"></a>
[33] **Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle** Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle: exactly right.

<a id="post-34"></a>
[34] **Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle** With that, I will turn things over to our CFO, Jeremy Fox Gein.

<a id="post-35"></a>
[35] **John Todaro, Analyst, Needham** John Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Yes. Great. Thank you for taking my question and congrats again. Thank you.

<a id="post-36"></a>
[36] **Tiffany, Conference Operator** Tiffany, Conference Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Cantwell with Seaport Research. Please go ahead.

<a id="post-37"></a>
[37] **Jeff Cantwell, Analyst, Seaport Research** Jeff Cantwell, Analyst, Seaport Research: Hey, thanks. First of all, congrats on the IPO. Also on the past year, Jeremy was being signed. I was thinking that for you and many others involved in the crypto industry. It probably was a long journey getting to that point. So I want to say congrats to you and to everybody who helped make that happen. Can you maybe talk about what you’ve seen? I just want to follow-up on the previous question. Post the Genus Act’s passing, it looks like your USDC in circulation was $61,000,000,000 in Q2 and now in August it’s $65,000,000,000 So it does sound like you’re seeing increasing demand. And I was hoping you can maybe give us a little color as to what you’re seeing since the Genus Act was passed just a few weeks ago. Is it more domestic or international growth? Can you just talk more about that? And then also wanted to ask, how are you thinking about the growth in USDC from here? You’re talking about a 40% CAGR. So how would you describe where you expect to see that growth come from? Will you mind just bucketing what are the incremental opportunities for USDC as you think ahead? That’d be great. Thanks.

<a id="post-38"></a>
[38] **Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle** Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle: Sure. I’ll take part of that and I’ll have Jeremy Foxken take part of that as well. So, I mean, the post Genius demand, again, as we just talked about, I’m mostly characterizing that around institutional interest in building on our stablecoin network, institutional interest in working with Circle, which as Jeremy Fox Gein just noted, these institutions and putting together relationships, implementing product, getting those products out and scaling will take time. I think the more recent growth as I see it reflects a kind of green light go view within the global environment to utilize stablecoins. That is certainly been fostered by the increasing activity in digital asset markets. But I think it’s broadly a kind of a signal to the market that this is now a form of digital cash like instrument that can be utilized. And so, it’s going to be interesting to see and I know that ties into your other question about growth. Obviously, with recent acceleration, we’ve grown 90% year over year and 49% year to date. But in terms of how to think about that going forward, I know Jeremy Foxkene, you have some thoughts on that and just our general philosophy around how to think about that because it is not a straightforward thing to guide on hence the approach that we take.

<a id="post-39"></a>
[39] **Jeremy Fox-Gein, Chief Financial Officer, Circle** Jeremy Fox-Gein, Chief Financial Officer, Circle: Thank you, Jeremy. I’ll talk a bit about how we view you referenced the 40% number we put out, how we view that. As I said in my remarks, right, the growth in USDC in circulation in many ways is the output over an entire economy. The digital asset markets with a bootstrap use case for stablecoins and represent the largest part of that economy today. But as I think we’ve been talking about on this call, we are seeing accelerating interest and growing adoption from every major financial services vertical for whom these new money technologies can bring tremendous advantages. This is very early days. We are right at the beginning of building the internet financial system. And there’s a multi year, if not multi decade growth for these new technologies within financial services. Specifically as to guidance, there is a growing number of third party research firms, financial industry analysts who are publishing research on stablecoin growth. And they all see not just the promise that I touched on, but multi year CAGRs and those growth rates range from kind of 25% CAGR at the low end up to 90% plus CAGR at the high end with from our reading the best current median at around a 60% CAGR. We believe in the benefits of these new technologies very, very strongly. When it comes to guidance, our core model and we run a range of scenarios to enable us to manage the business in an uncertain environment. But our core model suggests a 40% CAGR. And if we can deliver that in terms of USDC growth, we believe that will deliver a compelling financial return for our investors.

<a id="post-40"></a>
[40] **Jeff Cantwell, Analyst, Seaport Research** Jeff Cantwell, Analyst, Seaport Research: Got it. Okay, great. And maybe as a follow-up, one of the frequent questions we’ve been asked for clarification on about your company post the IPO is, Where is the on chain transaction volume coming from? Can you walk through that in more detail? You just reported $5,900,000,000,000 in on chain. So maybe can you discuss the use cases, maybe even geographically where the transactions are coming from? I think a lot of the interest is because public investors are still trying to get a better feel for the world of crypto whereas the world of fiat is still as much more familiar for the obvious reason here in The U. S. So maybe can you talk to us about where the $5,900,000,000,000 is being generated? That would be very helpful. Thanks.

<a id="post-41"></a>
[41] **Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle** Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle: I can touch on that. And I think as you know public blockchain data does not include geographic IP addresses or things like that. But there are very good heuristics to look at this. In fact, I think there’s some excellent third party research firms that do focused research on blockchain data, blockchain analytics. And we look at that and look at other data sources. What I can certainly say is, it’s highly distributed geographically. There’s an enormous amount of traffic in USDC that is around the world, Europe, Asia, emerging and developing markets, Latin America, Middle East, Africa, Southeast Asia. So it is very geographically distributed. And while The U. S. Is important, it is not the majority. And so we see that geographic distribution in the data that we’re able to look at. And obviously, we can identify activity that is specifically USDC that’s moving between exchanges or super wallets and things like that. And oftentimes we’ll correlate that to investing activity, savings activity, but also for payments activity. We know for example that peer to peer payments in emerging developing markets using stablecoins are a significant use case. But most of those peer to peer payments are intermediated by the big wallets that are attached to these big, what I think of as financial super apps, the Coinbase products or the Binance products, where people in those markets are using them not just for trading and investing, they’re using them for savings, to earn yields, and for P2P payments as well. And so once the USDC gets into one of those big platforms, we can’t track inside of there exactly all the flows and what people are doing. But those are some comments that I can give. I don’t know if you want to add anything, Jeremy.

<a id="post-42"></a>
[42] **Jeremy Fox-Gein, Chief Financial Officer, Circle** Jeremy Fox-Gein, Chief Financial Officer, Circle: Yes. I’d add on a little onto that just to give kind of a top down conceptual understanding of what this even means, right? In today’s world, every money movement use case, so think kind of consumer payments through credit card networks, remittances, international kind of money transfers via swift. Every single use case effectively has a different technology delivery stack. With the internet, we are seeing the emergence of the first ever general purpose architecture for money movement. And so on chain transactions include money movement across all financial services use cases, which is almost a radical difference, certainly a tremendous difference to the existing system. So what does that mean? When we think about those use cases, just as examples, Visa moves somewhat north of $10,000,000,000,000 a year through its consumer to business and business to business rails. And that’s one number that’s off cited. But let’s not forget, JPMorgan as an example moves somewhat north of $10,000,000,000,000 a day in gross money movement and gross money settlement as well as other use cases. And so all of that is intermingled in on chain transactions for stablecoins. And so it’s as Jeremy said, it’s difficult to disaggregate all of those different money uses, but we should not forget that all of those money use cases are represented in these numbers.

<a id="post-43"></a>
[43] **Jeff Cantwell, Analyst, Seaport Research** Jeff Cantwell, Analyst, Seaport Research: Perfect. Great. Thanks again.

<a id="post-44"></a>
[44] **Tiffany, Conference Operator** Tiffany, Conference Operator: Next question comes from the line of James Yarrow with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

<a id="post-45"></a>
[45] **Jeremy Fox-Gein, Chief Financial Officer, Circle** Jeremy Fox-Gein, Chief Financial Officer, Circle: Thank you, Jeremy, and good morning, everyone. I’m excited to be here with you all for our first earnings as a public company. I’ll start by walking briefly through the fundamentals of our business and financial model and then turn to the financial and operating results for the quarter. As Jeremy noted, stablecoins are network businesses with Internet scale potential. Successful networks are valuable and enduring, and our strategy is to build the largest stablecoin network. We make money in two ways. First, we monetize the money stock on the network through reserve income, which we earn on the cash equivalent assets we hold to back our stablecoins. And we are also starting to monetize certain transaction flows and elements of our network infrastructure. While these other revenues are small today, they are growing, are high margin and also have the potential to scale rapidly with network adoption and usage. Finally, we are an Internet platform business with a highly scalable model and inherent operating leverage with the potential to deliver strong profit growth and margin expansion over time. Let me now review the quarter. Circle’s stablecoin network continues to grow strongly. USDC on chain transaction volume was up 5.4 times year on year. CCTP volume showed similar growth, up 4.1 times year on year, demonstrating the importance of blockchain interoperability. Meaningful wallets defined as wallets holding more than $10 of USDC were up 68% year on year as USDC adoption continues to expand globally. USDC in circulation stood at $61,300,000,000 at quarter end, up 90% year on year and was at $65,200,000,000 as of August 10, up 6.4% since quarter end. USDC held within Circle’s platform infrastructure grew 10 times year on year, reaching 10% of total circulation at quarter end as more partners build using our platform infrastructure. The reserve return rate was 4.14% for the second quarter, reflecting the decline in SOFA during this period. Total revenue and reserve income increased 53% year on year to $658,000,000 in the second quarter as growth in USDC and circulation was partly offset by a lower reserve return rate. Total distribution transaction and other costs increased 64% year on year to $4.00 $7,000,000 The increase was driven by higher average USDC balances held on Coinbase’s platform and other partner incentives as we continue to build and grow partnerships to drive USDC growth and adoption. As a result, our revenue less distribution cost margin was 38% in the second quarter. Other revenue increased to $24,000,000 in the second quarter, up 3.5 times year on year. This was primarily driven by a $13,000,000 increase in subscription and services revenue, mostly from our blockchain network partnerships. Transaction revenues grew strongly to $5,800,000 in the second quarter, up from $1,600,000 in Q1. Our other revenues carry a higher margin than our net reserve margin and added 2.2 percentage points to margin overall in the second quarter. Total revenue and reserve income less distribution transaction and other costs was $251,000,000 in the second quarter, 38% year on year. Adjusted operating expenses, which excludes depreciation and amortization, non operating digital asset gains and losses and stock based compensation were $128,000,000 for the quarter, as we continue to invest in growing our platform at this pivotal moment for our industry. Adjusted EBITDA was $126,000,000 in the quarter, up 52% year on year and delivering a 50% adjusted EBITDA margin, reflecting the strong operating leverage inherent in our business model. Now let me turn to our outlook. Our goal is to help investors and analysts understand our business and how we manage it as best as possible.

<a id="post-46"></a>
[46] **John Todaro, Analyst, Needham** John Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask firstly on the outlook for non dollar stablecoins and the necessity for growth of these in your view to facilitate stablecoin cross border payments and thus CPN? And then perhaps just how you can, I guess, to what degree you plan to facilitate that with EURC?

<a id="post-47"></a>
[47] **Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle** Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle: Thanks, James. It’s a good question. So over the long run, we are very optimistic that virtually every major country in the world will have a good stablecoin policy regime and that we’ll see proliferation in high quality regulated payment stablecoins. We believe Genius Act is actually driving that and we’re seeing that with legislators and governments around the world who are now really racing to get their stablecoin policies in place. And so we do expect that proliferation. We want to work with these non dollar stablecoins. We obviously issue EURC and that has done well. But we want to work with these non dollar stablecoins because on chain money is more effective and efficient money. It’s programmable money. From a cross border perspective, if you can have a 20 fourseven, three sixty five continuously settled, atomically swappable PVP exchange, that’s a very powerful building block. And it’s one of the reasons why we are building such an engine into our own core blockchain network arc is that we want to see that mature because we think that as a, again, a programmable building block for commerce, trade and various types of capital markets activity, that’s going to be really important. Now, short of that all maturing, and we do believe it will mature, it is not necessarily an impediment to growing use of stablecoins in cross border settlement. And CPN itself really, from the start, the kind of FX model is designed to connect stablecoins to local currency liquidity and local electronic money rails. And so a person sending money from Portugal to a person in Brazil, they might have EURC or USDC sitting on one side of that transaction. And on the other side, there are essentially takers of that, what we call our BFIs, who have liquidity of USDC against local Brazilian real. And they can effectively price against existing kind of prices in the market or they’re competing on price. And then they can effectively use the immediate credit of the USDC to then initiate that near real time payment on the ultimate bank transferred money. And so, there are ways to do that. And there are also ways to have the on chain FX market basically be an on chain FX market where the market and the pricing is all completed but where the fulfillment on the currency side is kind of post trade. And so that’s also a structure that we expect to see develop more as well. But again, long term, we’re very much encouraging of and want to see more and more what we call, the local partner stablecoins. We wanna see them issue on the ARK blockchain. We wanna support them on CPN. We wanna support them in in Circle Mint and in our wallets. And we wanna we wanna be very multi stablecoin in what we do, and we believe that’s part of building the Internet financial system.

<a id="post-48"></a>
[48] **John Todaro, Analyst, Needham** John Todaro, Analyst, Needham: Very clear. On another topic, maybe you could just talk a little bit about the opportunity for Circle Gateway and then perhaps how this, I guess, differs or integrates with Circle CCTP?

<a id="post-49"></a>
[49] **Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle** Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle: Yeah. Absolutely. So, Circle Gateway and Circle, Circle CCTP, solve similar but somewhat different problems. So CCTP is protocol at a kind of low level. It’s a low level protocol that allows for cross chain settlement of USDC across a multitude of different blockchains. It’s used quite significantly in cross chain USDC today. The last time I looked, I think it was well over 80% of cross chain USDC was running through CCTP. And we have a version two of that, which has continued to grow as well. So that allowed that’s kind of a more lower level in a sense. It doesn’t solve kind of what what we think of as, like, the user experience problem. In in the in the world of CCPP, you know, what we find is that there are a lot of wallets, whether it’s an institutional wallet or a consumer wallet, where you still end up in a world where you need to kinda know, like, which chains do I have USDC on, and which chains, you know, do I wanna get the USDC to. And so the UX is is a is a hurdle. And so Circle Gateway is really designed as an abstraction to, eliminate that user experience hurdle. So a user, again, this could be an institution or or or an individual, just sees a a USDC balance. So they say, I have 10,000 USDC, and they can essentially spend that balance, in less than a second, to any of the supported chains. And so you can kinda just say, hey, I have USDC. What kind of wallet do you have? Or give me a QR code or or give me an address, and it can spend seamlessly to those. So it really simplifies the UX. This is part of our goal of just kind of having the crypto disappear into the background and make this a more streamlined experience. So Circle Gateway is a different architecture to accomplish that, and it’s something that we’re really primarily bringing to market through developers who are going to integrate this into their products and services. And like CCTV version two, it also does include new opportunities for monetization for Circle. And so, user experience is a feature. We want to monetize that and also just make these products better for people who are using them.

[52] **John Andrews, VP of Capital Markets and Investor Relations, Circle0** John Andrews, VP of Capital Markets and Investor Relations, Circle0: Great, great. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and also congrats on the very successful IPO. Maybe a big picture question on growing USDC over time within the industry and the desire to make this a winner take most and increase the scale and network effects of the USDC. I mean, I guess, Jeremy, what’s your appetite for partnering with more institutions? And if that means higher distribution costs and lower reserve margins, is that something that you find appealing to grow USDC? Or do you really think about the reserve margin as something you want to keep in that mid-30s range at least?

<a id="post-53"></a>
[53] **Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle** Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle: Yes. I can take part of that and maybe Jeremy Soxdin can take the other part of it. So first of all, we have a very strong appetite for growing the partnerships, you know, that that are gonna grow our network. And I I would say it it’s helpful to kinda remind folks that, you know, we have many, many different types of partnerships. A partnership with a digital wallet is completely different than a partnership with a merchant acquirer, which is completely different than a partnership with a a large exchange that has hundreds of millions of users. So there there are many, many different types of partners that we work with. And each one of those partnerships, you know, has a has a unique, you know, deal deal format to it. So we have we have a lot of different deal playbooks that we execute. And I think, it’s it’s sort of simplistic to think that every deal has to do with giving away reserve income. That is not the case. We focus on partnerships where each party is a, focused on delivering value for their customers. So how are they going to grow value for their customers through this partnership? And b, that it’s a win win growth oriented model. So we wanna build economic relationships that incentivize growth so that we’re seeing that the partnership is actually having an impact on whether it be transaction velocity or market share shift or USDC growth itself. So we really focus on these win win growth oriented relationships. It’s not a carte blanche, here’s a rate card, go do this kind of thing. We wanna build. We wanna build with people who wanna build and grow with us, and that’s our filter for this. And I think that that is working. I think Jeremy maybe can comment more on just sort of how we think about that vis a vis RLDC margin and the outlook there.

<a id="post-54"></a>
[54] **Jeremy Fox-Gein, Chief Financial Officer, Circle** Jeremy Fox-Gein, Chief Financial Officer, Circle: Thank you, Jeremy. I’ll build on that and then get to the numbers piece of it. But it’s important to understand that the strength and breadth of our platform capabilities combined with our position as market neutral infrastructure, encourages more players and enables even fierce competitors, right, to build on and integrate with our platform. And so our partners then bring the benefits of these new money technologies to their customers, benefiting their customers, building their business and growing USDC usage and adoption, which strengthens our network with more capabilities, more users, more distribution. And this is a network business with network effect and our position strengthens as the network strengthens. And that’s important context for our future outlook on our LDC margin. We’re not guiding beyond 2025 at this time. However, I think of three factors that provide relative strength tailwinds, if you like, relative strength to this margin over time. The first would be the growing strength from network effects, which is what I was just talking about. And we see that in our commercial discussions. And we also know that and this is important to remember growth in USDC held within partner infrastructure and which may be subject to incentives also leads to growth in USDC in the ecosystem more broadly held outside of partner infrastructure. So we see growing strength from network effects. That’s the first point. The second, we see growth in USDC held within Circle’s platform infrastructure. We have a broad based feature rich platform as I just mentioned and our position as market neutral infrastructure only enables more people to build upon our platform over time. And that’s important. And we have greater economic flexibility with USDC held within our platform infrastructure. And then finally, we have growth in our high margin other revenues, right? Predominantly today, we make money from the stock of money on the network. Over time and through products we’ve already launched and started talking about even as they’re nascent today, we will be monetizing certain of the flows across that network infrastructure where we are able to add value added services to the benefit of the users. And so we see this growth in other revenues over time and those are very high margin revenues and provide strength to our overall margin over time. So those three things combined we think provide longer term relative strength to our RLDC margin.

<a id="post-55"></a>
[55] **Tiffany, Conference Operator** Tiffany, Conference Operator: That concludes our question and answer session. I will now turn the call back over to John Andrews for closing remarks.

<a id="post-56"></a>
[56] **Jeremy Fox-Gein, Chief Financial Officer, Circle** We are at the beginning of meaningful structural shifts in the global markets for money, and we are managing our business for long term success. As such, we do not intend to give short term quarterly guidance. We do intend, however, to give full year guidance on certain key metrics. We will evolve this guidance each quarter with our financial results as needed. USDC in circulation is not a forecastable metric in the traditional sense and is in many ways the outcome of an entire economy of activity. There is a growing body of third party research on stablecoin growth with multi year forecast CAGRs ranging from 25% to 90% with a median of 60%. Our core model anticipates multi year through cycle USDC growth of a 40% CAGR, reflecting our conservative nature. We anticipate other revenue to range between $75,000,000 and $85,000,000 for 2025, primarily driven by subscription and services revenue from our blockchain network partnerships, which can vary quarter on quarter, along with transaction revenues, which are small today, but growing. We anticipate an RLDC margin of between 3638% for 2025. While RLDC margin for the first half of the year was 39%, we continue to invest in partnerships with industry leading institutions to grow USDC adoption. Adjusted operating expenses we expect will range between $475,000,004 $90,000,000 in 2025, as we continue to invest in key areas to build out our platform, our capabilities and our global partnerships. This would represent a full year growth rate of between 2024%. In closing, we have had a strong first half and are executing at an accelerating pace against the significant opportunity in front of us. Thank you to our investors and analysts for your support and engagement, and we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. With that, operator, we can now start the Q and A portion of the call.

[57] **John Andrews, VP of Capital Markets and Investor Relations, Circle** John Andrews, VP of Capital Markets and Investor Relations, Circle: Great, Tiffany. Thank you. And apologies for the couple of people who got stuck in the queue, but we are up against a hard time end here. We are happy to follow-up with everybody. You know how to reach us through the investors’ website at circle.com, and enjoy the rest of the day.

[58] **Tiffany, Conference Operator** Tiffany, Conference Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.

<a id="post-59"></a>
[59] **Tiffany, Conference Operator** Tiffany, Conference Operator: We kindly ask that you limit yourself to one and one follow-up for today’s call Your first question comes from the line of Joseph Vafi with Canaccord. Please go ahead.

<a id="post-60"></a>
[60] **Joseph Vafi, Analyst, Canaccord** Joseph Vafi, Analyst, Canaccord: Hey, Jeremy and Jeremy, great results here and congrats on your IPO, which was obviously a great success and your first earnings call. Just a couple for me. One, the news on ARC, obviously very exciting. Do you believe that the gas fees and the like are the first step here in the revenue model for USDC or maybe for transactions away from trading pairs and the like is ARC going to be and the gas fee is going to be kind of the basis for transaction fees here for broader transactions with USBC? And I have a quick follow-up.

<a id="post-61"></a>
[61] **Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle** Jeremy Allaire, Co-Founder, CEO and Chairman, Circle: Sure. Thanks, Joe. Look, a few things here. First, we’re very excited about ARC. There’s a lot more information out about it. ARC, we want to underpin all stablecoin finance payments, FX, capital markets applications, and it’s really designed to support mainstream regulated financial institutions who want to build on chain and build financial products and services on chain. And so we’re excited and we believe that a lot of traffic can move on to a network like ARC. And yes, the gas fees, which are denominated in USDC, can become a source of revenue. And we’ll certainly as this goes into test net and ultimately launches on main net, we’ll have a lot more to say about that. But I would also say just to contextualize it, we have a number of transaction fee revenue streams that are emerging. And Jeremy referred in his remarks to the kind of growth in transaction fee revenue, which was very solid on an annualized basis we’re continuing to see. So many new products and services that we’re building include transaction fee components to them. And of course that includes CPN as we scale that and includes premium features of Circle Mint. It includes features of USYC, our yield token. And so we’re adding more and more transaction fee models. But you are correct that ARC does have an underlying gas fee transaction fee model built on USDC.

### Round 1

<a id="post-62"></a>
[62] **Institutional Portfolio Manager** [Strength] USYC–USDC 24/7 convertibility plus Binance collateralization creates a new, investable "cash + margin" sleeve for institutions: hold yield-bearing USYC as collateral while deploying USDC as trading/settlement cash, compressing financing costs and improving liquidity utilization; ARC gas-in-USDC and CPN corridors add incremental transaction-fee optionality diversifying away from rate dependency. | Falsifier: Slippage >10 bps or USYC→USDC latency >5s {Conf: Med} _(🔄 1)_

[63] **Blockchain Infrastructure Lead** [Risk] If ARC targets bounded/predictable USDC fees, spam/DoS resistance likely shifts from price to non-price controls (identity quotas, allowlists, or centralized scheduling), concentrating discretion in vetted validators and reducing permissionless composability—eroding developer-driven network effects versus open L1s.

[65] **Financial Regulator (Emerging Markets)** [Risk] ARC’s opt-in confidential transfers, USDC-as-gas, and Circle-vetted validators create “obliged entity” exposure across FATF R.16/Travel Rule because fee collection and validator operations may constitute VASP/payment services in each corridor (e.g., Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria), while ARC’s native FX/PvP likely triggers local FX/PSP licensing; combined, cross-border perimeter mismatches could force geofencing, add per-corridor KYC/data-localization, and inflate compliance opex—pressuring RLDC margin and delaying CPN scaling.

[66] **Retail Crypto User Advocate** [Strength] Circle’s consumer trust flywheel is forming: CPN live in remittance-heavy corridors, Gateway hides chain complexity, and USDC-as-gas removes native-token hurdles—critical for first-time users entering via Fiserv/FIS/Shopify funnels.

<a id="post-67"></a>
[67] **Global Macro Strategist** [Risk] Reserve-income sensitivity: a Fed easing cycle would compress short-end yields, reducing net reserve income even if USDC supply grows, while partner incentives to win share could keep RLDC margins tight; high‑margin “other revenue” must scale faster to offset. | Falsifier: Short rates stable/rising or other revenue > guidance {Conf: Med} _(🔄 8)_

[68] **Independent Market Skeptic & Columnist** [Risk] RLDC margin faces a 2025–26 dual squeeze if rates fall while ARC cannibalizes “other revenue”: lower reserve yields cut income as partner incentives (often balance/volume‑linked) stay sticky, and shifting from chain‑partner integrations to a proprietary L1 could displace high‑margin blockchain partnership fees that added 2.2pp in Q2.

[69] **Crypto Legal Counsel (Capital Markets)** [Risk] ARC’s “native FX engine” with Circle‑vetted validators may trigger trading‑venue/payment‑system obligations (EU MiFID II MTF/PSR; US ATS/SEF or designated payment system) because it enables centrally governed multilateral PVP price formation and settlement in USDC, giving Circle operator control and access rules. Licensing, capital, transparency, surveillance, and fair‑access could materially raise costs and slow onboarding. | Falsifier: Regulator opinion: ARC not multilateral matching/venue/payment system {Conf: Med} _(🔄 8)_

[70] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What does the ARC public testnet documentation specify about its fee mechanism (e.g., EIP‑1559-style base fee or fixed pricing), block gas limits, and spam/congestion controls (including whether allowlists or identity quotas are used), as of the latest technical release? A: Which "ARC" do you mean? There are multiple projects called ARC/Arc with public testnets. Pick one and I’ll fetch the latest technical release and answer your fee/gas/spam questions. Options (examples): - Circle’s Arc (new stablecoin‑focused L1; public testnet announced Fall 2025). ([theblock.co](https://www.theblock.co/post/366540/circle-stablecoin-focused-evm-compatible-layer-1-blockchain-arc?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - TAAL / Bitcoin‑SV “ARC” API and ARC testnet (transaction API for BSV). ([docs.taal.com](https://docs.taal.com/core-products/transaction-processing/arc-endpoints?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - ARC (chain ID 1244 / ArchieChain / “ARC Testnet” listed on ChainList). ([chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org/chain/1244?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Reply with which one (or paste a link) and I’ll look up the latest docs and give a concise, sourced summary.

<a id="post-71"></a>
[71] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What are the published corridor‑level consumer off‑ramp metrics for CPN—specifically the spread to local‑currency mid‑market FX, median settlement times to bank/mobile wallet, and transaction failure or reversal rates—as of August 12, 2025? A: Short answer: Circle has not published corridor‑level consumer off‑ramp metrics (spread vs. local mid‑market FX, median bank/mobile‑wallet settlement times, or failure/reversal rates) in public materials as of Aug 12, 2025. Public CPN docs describe that payout fees and FX spreads are corridor/BFI‑specific and that settlement is “near‑instant,” but they do not list corridor‑level spreads, median settlement times, or published failure/reversal rates — those details appear to be provided to network members/partners (or individual BFIs) rather than in public reports. ([circle.com](https://www.circle.com/cpn), [6778953.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net](https://6778953.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/6778953/PDFs/Whitepapers/CPN_Whitepaper.pdf), [streetinsider.com](https://www.streetinsider.com/Business%2BWire/Circle%2BReports%2BSecond%2BQuarter%2B2025%2BResults/25183719.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you need corridor‑level numbers, the next step is to request them from Circle/CPN or from the specific BFI(s) operating the corridor (member dashboard / contractual SLAs typically contain those metrics).

<a id="post-72"></a>
[72] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What are the published average and 95th‑percentile latency and price slippage for USYC-to-USDC conversions via Circle’s official issuance/redemption channels, and are there stated 24/7 uptime or service‑level targets as of August 12, 2025? A: Short answer (as of Aug 12, 2025): Circle does not publish numeric average or 95th‑percentile latency or price‑slippage numbers for USYC→USDC redemptions in its public docs. Circle’s public materials state redemptions are available 24/7/365 and “settle in one block time” below instant‑redemption capacity (otherwise T+0 or T+1), and list chain confirmation settings — but no published pct/latency or slippage statistics or formal uptime‑SLA percentages are provided in public terms. If you need measured percentiles, you must request them from Circle (enterprise/Private Teller) or run empirical tests.

[73] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What portion of Q2 2025 revenue plus reserve income was attributable to reserve income versus transaction and service fees and other revenue, as disclosed in Circle’s Q2 2025 earnings materials and SEC filing? A: Circle reported total revenue + reserve income of $658.078 million for Q2 2025: reserve income was $634.274 million (≈96.4%) and transaction & service fees plus other revenue totaled $23.804 million (≈3.6%).

[74] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: Which centralized exchanges, including Binance, currently accept USYC as collateral, and what are the posted collateral haircuts, margin eligibility parameters, and funding/borrowing rate differentials versus USDC as of August 12, 2025? A: Short answer (as of Aug 12, 2025): - Deribit — accepts USYC as cross‑margin collateral; Deribit published an initial cross‑collateral haircut of 10% at launch and enables USYC to collateralize BTC/ETH/USDC/USDT derivatives. Deribit does not publish a spot “borrowing rate” for USYC; USYC’s on‑token yield was last quoted on Deribit’s pages (historic 4.325% five‑day avg, 10‑Feb‑2024). ([insights.deribit.com](https://insights.deribit.com/exchange-updates/deribit-introduces-hashnotes-usyc-as-new-yield-bearing-cross-margin-collateral-option/), [support.deribit.com](https://support.deribit.com/hc/en-us/articles/25944635435421-Yield-bearing-coins?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Binance — Circle announced Binance institutional clients may use USYC as off‑exchange collateral (July 24, 2025). Binance/Circle press materials do not publish a public collateral haircut, margin‑eligibility matrix or an exchange‑level borrowing/funding rate differential vs USDC; those terms appear handled via institutional triparty/custody arrangements.

If you need vendor‑grade SLA figures I can (a) request Circle/partners’ public SLA docs or (b) contact them for confirmation. ([circle.com](https://www.circle.com/cpn?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [developers.circle.com](https://developers.circle.com/cpn?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can compile a table with each public citation or try to obtain the CPN Rules / partner SLA documents.

[76] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: Have any U.S. or EU regulators issued guidance, opinions, or determinations on whether ARC’s native FX engine and PvP settlement constitute operation of an ATS/SEF (U.S.) or an MTF (EU) or a designated payment system, and if so, what specific licensing or compliance obligations were identified, as of August 12, 2025? A: Short answer: No — as of August 12, 2025 there are no public U.S. or EU regulator guidance, opinions, or formal determinations specifically saying that Circle’s newly‑announced Arc (its integrated FX engine / PvP settlement) is an ATS/SEF (U.S.), an MTF (EU) or a “designated payment system.” Circle announced Arc on Aug 12, 2025. ([theblock.co](https://www.theblock.co/post/366540/circle-stablecoin-focused-evm-compatible-layer-1-blockchain-arc?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Context: regulators have issued relevant, but general, guidance that would bear on any such analysis — e.g. the CFTC’s April 9, 2025 interpretive letter on FX product characterization and ESMA’s Opinion on the “trading venue perimeter” (which explains when a system may qualify as a multilateral trading venue). Those documents set the legal tests but do not apply them to Arc. ([cftc.gov](https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9064-25?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [esma.europa.eu](https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-issues-opinion-trading-venue-perimeter?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can (a) monitor/reg-search for any formal regulator statements after Aug 12, 2025, or (b) map likely licensing/compliance permutations against Arc’s public technical/design docs.

[77] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What is Circle’s disclosed interest‑rate sensitivity of reserve income (e.g., estimated change in annualized reserve income for a 100 bp parallel shift in short‑term rates) and the weighted‑average duration and composition of the USDC reserve portfolio as of Q2 2025? A: Short answer — Q2 2025 (June 30, 2025): - Interest‑rate sensitivity: Circle’s internal 12‑month stress model shows a +100 bp parallel rise in short‑term yields would increase annualized reserve income by about $618 million (and a −100 bp cut would reduce it by ~$618m). (table, Item 3).

[78] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: Which jurisdictions has Circle disclosed obtaining or applying for money transmission, e‑money, payment services, FX dealer, or designated payment system licenses relevant to ARC operations and CPN cross‑border payouts (e.g., Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria), and what Travel Rule (FATF Recommendation 16) compliance framework is specified for ARC validators as of August 12, 2025? A: Short answer — jurisdictions disclosed (licenses / applications) and Travel‑Rule framework for Arc validators (as of 12 Aug 2025): - Licenses / applications Circle has publicly disclosed: numerous U.S. state money‑transmitter licences (45–46 states via Circle Internet Financial, LLC), FCA e‑money issuer (UK), MAS Major Payments Institution (Singapore), ACPR electronic‑money institution (France), Bermuda Digital Asset Business license, and public disclosures about applying for EU DASP/EMI authority under MiCA and an OCC national trust charter. Circle’s public “Licenses” page and SEC/press filings list these. ([circle.com](https://www.circle.com/legal/licenses?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1876042/000095012324003285/filename1.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Brazil / Mexico / Nigeria: Circle announced integrations into Brazil’s PIX and Mexico’s SPEI (USDC on‑ramps via partner banks) but does not list Brazil, Mexico or Nigeria national money‑transmitter/PSP licences on its public licenses page as of the cited updates; Circle has not published a disclosed Nigeria licence. (I did not find a Circle disclosure of local Brazil/Mexico/Nigeria licences). ([circle.com](https://www.circle.com/blog/usdc-now-available-in-brazil-and-mexico-through-national-payment-systems-with-local-currency?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Travel Rule (FATF R.16) for Arc validators (as of 12 Aug 2025): Circle’s public materials state Travel‑Rule enforcement will follow FATF guidance via the Circle Payments Network rules and Trust/Compliance tooling (TRUST, Verite research, Compliance Engine / Travel‑Rule on‑chain concepts). Arc’s materials reference “selective disclosure / view keys” and opt‑in privacy to enable privacy‑preserving disclosures — but Circle has not published a separate, validator‑specific Travel‑Rule rulebook for Arc validators as of that date. In short: Travel‑Rule compliance is to be enforced consistent with FATF R.16 through CPN rules and Circle’s Travel‑Rule/Verifiable‑Credential tooling; validator‑specific mandates were not fully specified publicly by 12‑Aug‑2025. ([circle.com](https://www.circle.com/cpn?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [developers.circle.com](https://developers.circle.com/verite/docs/travel-rule-research?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [cryptoslate.com](https://cryptoslate.com/circle-to-launch-l1-blockchain-called-arc-sparking-concerns-over-centralization-and-governance/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can pull the exact licence list (state-by-state) and fetch the Arc litepaper/CPN rules pages and mark any text that mentions validators or Travel‑Rule obligations.

[79] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What was Circle’s RLDC (revenue less direct costs) margin in Q2 2025, and how many percentage points of RLDC margin were contributed by blockchain partnership fees and by partner incentives, respectively, as disclosed in the Q2 2025 earnings materials? A: RLDC (revenue less distribution costs) margin — 38% in Q2 2025. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1876042/000162828025039749/q22025epr.htm)) Circle said its “other” revenue (driven primarily by subscription/services from blockchain network partnerships) added about 2.2 percentage points to RLDC margin in Q2 2025. ([investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-circle-internet-q2-2025-stock-jumps-on-strong-revenue-93CH-4185242?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) The company noted distribution/transaction costs rose due to higher on‑platform balances and “partner incentives,” but the Q2 2025 earnings materials do not separately quantify partner incentives as a specific number of percentage points of RLDC margin.

<a id="post-82"></a>
[82] **Crypto Payments Industry Operator** [Strength] Gateway’s single-balance abstraction plus USDC-as-gas removes two chronic onboarding frictions—wrong‑chain sends and needing native tokens to pay fees—reducing support tickets, refund loops, and treasury ops overhead for enterprises, which should shorten time-to-live and improve retention/TPV ramp. | Falsifier: Support/ops ticket rate unchanged post‑Gateway {Conf: Med} _(🔄 2)_

[88] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 12, 2025, have the U.S. CFTC or NFA issued any public guidance, rules, or no-action letters indicating whether ARC’s peer-to-peer foreign-exchange functionality would be treated as retail forex under CEA §2(c)(2)(C), and, if so, what RFED/FCM/IB registration, capital, leverage, disclosure, and Part 5 compliance obligations would apply? A: Short answer: I could not find any public CFTC or NFA rulemaking, interpretive letter, or no‑action letter that specifically addresses an entity called “ARC” and its peer‑to‑peer FX functionality as of August 12, 2025. The CFTC/NFA have, however, long-standing retail‑forex rules that would govern a P2P service that effectively offers leveraged/retail FX (registration as an RFED/FCM or IB where applicable; FDM/FCM net‑capital standards (e.g., $20M floor + 5% add‑on); NFA leverage/security‑deposit and disclosure/recordkeeping requirements; and CFTC Part 5 registration rules).

[89] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: Have any national regulators publicly determined that Circle must obtain local payment, e-money, money transmitter, or foreign-exchange licenses to operate Circle Payments Network or ARC in their jurisdictions notwithstanding partnerships with licensed processors (such as Fiserv, FIS, Matera, or CorePay), and if so, which countries and license types have been specified as of August 12, 2025? A: Short answer: Yes — national regulators have publicly required local licensing for stablecoin issuance/distribution or payment services that Circle needed to satisfy (notably Japan and jurisdictions in the EU/UK/Singapore), though I found no public ruling that specifically names “Circle Payments Network” or “ARC” and says those products alone must be licensed regardless of processor partners. Examples (public sources): - Japan (JFSA): Japan’s stablecoin law requires local distribution via JFSA‑licensed intermediaries (“EPIESPs”) and a local trust/reserve arrangement — Circle documents this structure. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1876042/000119312525121234/d737521ds1a.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - France / EU (ACPR / MiCA): France’s ACPR required e‑money/EMI authorization under MiCA for issuing e‑money tokens in the EU; Circle obtained an EMI in France. ([businesswire.com](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240701820713/en/Circle-is-First-Global-Stablecoin-Issuer-to-Comply-with-MiCA-EU%E2%80%99s-Landmark-Crypto-Law?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [degaullefleurance.com](https://www.degaullefleurance.com/en/advised-by-de-gaulle-fleurance-circle-obtains-approval-as-an-electronic-money-institution-emi-from-the-french-supervisory-authority-the-acpr/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Singapore / UK: Circle states it holds MAS (MPI) and UK FCA e‑money authorization — reflecting those regulators’ licensing requirements for payment/e‑money activities. ([circle.com](https://www.circle.com/legal/licenses?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1876042/000119312525135795/d737521d424b4.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can produce a jurisdiction-by‑jurisdiction table with the primary regulator text and exact license citations.

[90] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What were the year-over-year growth rates for Circle’s transaction and service fees and other revenue in Q2 2025, and how do those growth rates compare with the year-over-year change in on-chain USDC transaction volume reported by Circle or cited third-party sources for the same period? A: - Other revenue (which Circle says is "largely from subscription, services and transaction fees") rose 252% year‑over‑year to $24M in Q2 2025. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1876042/000162828025039749/q22025epr.htm)) - Within that mix, Circle reported transaction revenue of $5.8M in Q2 (subscription & services rose by ~$13M vs prior periods). ([investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-circle-internet-q2-2025-stock-jumps-on-strong-revenue-93CH-4185242?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - By comparison, Circle (via its earnings slides, cited by reporters) said on‑chain USDC transaction volume reached ~$5.9 trillion in Q2 — a ~5.4× year‑over‑year increase (≈+440%). That growth outpaced the rise in other/fee revenue (440% vs 252%).

[91] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: According to Circle’s Q2 2025 earnings materials and SEC filing, what was the year-over-year change in USDC on-chain velocity, and what percentages of total USDC supply were reported as held on Circle’s platform as of June 30, 2025 and as of August 10, 2025? A: - On‑chain velocity: Circle reported on‑chain USDC transaction volume rose 5.4x YoY to ~$5.9T in Q2; average USDC in circulation rose 86% YoY — implying on‑chain velocity rose by ~5.4/1.86 ≈ 2.9× year‑over‑year (≈+190%). ([pymnts.com](https://www.pymnts.com/earnings/2025/circle-usdc-volume-hits-6-trillion-dollars-race-first-mover-advantage/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1876042/000162828025039749/q22025epr.htm)) - USDC held on Circle’s platform: - As of June 30, 2025: USDC on‑platform = $6.0B vs. circulation $61.3B → ≈9.8% (Circle rounded to “~10%”). ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1876042/000162828025039749/q22025epr.htm)) - As of August 10, 2025: Circle disclosed circulation = $65.2B but did not disclose an updated on‑platform balance for Aug 10 in the earnings materials; using the June 30 on‑platform figure as a numerator gives 6.0/65.2 ≈ 9.2% (this is a pro‑rata calculation, not an updated Circle disclosure).

[92] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: How does Circle define “meaningful wallets” in its public disclosures, and what were the reported counts or year-over-year growth rates of meaningful wallets for Q2 2025 versus Q2 2024? A: Definition: Circle defines "meaningful wallets" (MeWs) as on‑chain digital asset wallets holding more than $10 of USDC. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1876042/000162828025039749/q22025epr.htm)) Reporteds: Q2 2025 = 5.7 million MeWs (up 68% year‑over‑year). Q2 2024 = 3.363 million MeWs (the prior‑year quarter in Circle’s quarterly disclosures).

[93] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: Which specific provisions of the U.S. GENIUS Act does Circle identify as materially affecting its business in its Q2 2025 earnings materials, and what effective dates and implementing rulemaking timelines are stated in official government publications for those provisions? A: Short answer — what Circle said (Q2‑2025) and the official timelines: - Circle identifies these GENIUS Act provisions as materially affecting its business: the Act’s definition of “payment stablecoin”; the prohibition on issuance except by a “permitted payment stablecoin issuer” (PPSI); the comprehensive PPSI regime (reserve requirements/limits on permissible reserve assets, supervision, capital/liquidity/risk-management, AML/BSA obligations), the general prohibition on PPSIs (and certain foreign issuers) paying interest on payment stablecoins, the statutory exclusion of PPSI-issued payment stablecoins from the definition of “security,” and treatment of foreign issuers. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1876042/000162828025039781/0001628280-25-039781-index.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Official timelines in the enacted law (GENIUS Act, Pub. L. No. 119‑27): the Act takes effect on the earlier of 18 months after enactment (Jan 18, 2027 — enactment = July 18, 2025) or 120 days after primary federal regulators issue final implementing regulations; primary federal + Treasury + state regulators must promulgate implementing rules by “not later than 1 year after” enactment (by July 18, 2026); FinCEN AML guidance/rulemaking deadlines appear in the statute as “not later than 3 years after” enactment (by July 18, 2028).

[94] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What do Circle’s public materials state about eligibility and access controls for ARC’s FX functionality in the United States as of August 12, 2025, specifically whether access is limited to Eligible Contract Participants and whether geofencing or other restrictions for U.S. retail users are in place? A: Short answer (as of Aug 12, 2025): Circle’s public materials announce Arc as an “enterprise‑grade” L1 with a built‑in stablecoin FX engine and describe FX/currency‑trading features as targeted at or available to “approved”/institutional counterparties, but they do not explicitly say access will be limited to CFTC “Eligible Contract Participants.” Circle’s investor/press materials also note Circle will only provide services where permitted by law and licensing (so Circle may restrict by jurisdiction or customer type), but I find no Circle statement on Aug 12, 2025 that Arc’s FX is geofenced or that U.S. retail users are categorically blocked. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1876042/000162828025039749/q22025epr.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [cryptoslate.com](https://cryptoslate.com/circle-to-launch-l1-blockchain-called-arc-sparking-concerns-over-centralization-and-governance/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can pull the exact language from Circle’s announcement and regulatory filings.

[103] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: Where are the Circle Payments Network (CPN) operating rules published, and what do they specify about corridor-level service-level agreements (payout latency and uptime), refund and return workflows with liability allocation, and standardized reason codes (e.g., ISO 20022/NACHA-style)? If a full rulebook is not public, is a non-member summary or redacted version available as of August 12, 2025? A: Short answer — the CPN operating rules (the “CPN Rules”) are authored and maintained by Circle and referenced from Circle’s public CPN pages (CPN product page, developer docs and white paper), but the detailed rulebook/Participation Agreement is not posted in full for the public as of Aug 12, 2025. Public Circle materials say the CPN Rules cover SLAs (uptime, transaction speed), dispute/ticketing and incident-management, corridor stress‑testing and member operational obligations — but Circle’s public docs do not publish numeric corridor‑level SLA targets (payout‑latency or uptime obligations), the detailed refund/return liability allocation rules, or a publicly‑posted canonical reason‑code list (ISO‑20022/NACHA style). Only high‑level summaries (whitepaper/blog/dev docs) are public; the full rulebook appears to be member‑only.

A: Short answer: No — I could not find any publicly released enterprise case studies or third‑party audited reports (as of Aug 12, 2025) that publish quantified percentage- or dollar‑reductions in native‑token inventory, FX operational float, or treasury costs specifically attributable to adopting Circle Gateway or Arc (or to paying gas in USDC across chains).

A: Short answer — statutory citations (GENIUS Act, S.919, text on Congress.gov): - Definition: “payment stablecoin” = digital asset used as a means of payment whose issuer (i) is obligated to convert/redeem for a fixed monetary value, or (ii) represents/creates a reasonable expectation of stable value, and (iii) meets exclusions (not a national currency, not a deposit, does not pay yield). (SEC. 2(15)). A “permitted payment stablecoin issuer” (PPSI) = U.S.‑incorporated person that is (A) a subsidiary of an insured depository institution approved under SEC.5, (B) a Federal‑qualified nonbank issuer approved under SEC.5, or (C) a State‑qualified issuer. (SEC. 2(16)). ([congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/919/text)) - Securities exclusion & issuer eligibility: The Act amends the Securities Act, Exchange Act, and Investment Company Act to exclude payment stablecoins issued by PPSIs. Issuers must be approved under SEC.5 and satisfy SEC.4 reserve/operational, no‑rehypothecation, reporting/audit and supervision rules. (see SECs. 3–6, 4, 5). ([congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/919/text)) - Timing and rulemaking: Effective on the earlier of 18 months after enactment or 120 days after primary federal payment stablecoin regulators issue final implementing regulations; regulators/Treasury/States must complete notice‑and‑comment rulemaking within 1 year of enactment (SEC.17–18). ([congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/919/text)) If you want, I can quote the exact statutory paragraphs.

[106] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 12, 2025, what do Circle Arc Layer-1 public documents specify about validator admission criteria (including KYC requirements, minimum capital or staking thresholds, and permitted jurisdictions), and what initial validator count is planned for mainnet launch? A: Short answer: As of Aug 12, 2025, Circle’s public Arc announcement and the company’s Q2/earnings materials describe Arc’s design (USDC as native gas, opt‑in privacy, testnet this fall) but do not publish validator admission rules. I could not find any Circle/Arc public document that specifies KYC/AML requirements, minimum capital or staking thresholds, permitted/blocked jurisdictions, or an initial mainnet validator count. (Press coverage and the SEC presentation mention a public testnet in fall 2025 and a later mainnet/beta timeline, but not validator admission details.) ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1876042/000162828025039749/q22025epr.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [theblock.co](https://www.theblock.co/post/366540/circle-stablecoin-focused-evm-compatible-layer-1-blockchain-arc?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can continue searching for announcements after Aug 12 (e.g., developer docs, whitepaper, or a Circle blogpost) and report back.

[107] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What percentages of total remittance inflows in 2024 and in 2025 year-to-date (through August 12, 2025) for Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria, and Hong Kong were settled in USDC or processed via Circle Payments Network, according to Circle or third-party sources, and are there audited case studies quantifying corridor penetration? Please provide citations. A: Short answer: There are no publicly‑published, authoritative percentages from Circle or independent auditors showing what share of total remittance inflows in 2024 or in 2025 YTD (through Aug 12, 2025) for Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria or Hong Kong were settled in USDC or routed via the Circle Payments Network. Circle launched CPN (active corridors include Brazil, Mexico, Nigeria, Hong Kong) but hasn’t published country‑level “% of remittance inflows” figures; third‑party researchers report related signals (e.g., Chainalysis shows very high stablecoin use in Nigeria’s crypto flows (~~40% of crypto inflows are stablecoins) but that is not the same as % of total national remittances). Circle publishes vendor case studies (Félix, BCRemit, etc.), but I could not find third‑party‑audited corridor‑penetration studies with country‑level %s. ([circle.com](https://www.circle.com/pressroom/circle-announces-payments-network-to-transform-global-money-movement?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [chainalysis.com](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/subsaharan-africa-crypto-adoption-2024/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can pull more granular exchange or regulator data (Bitso, central banks) and check whether any auditors or consultancies have unpublished/paid reports with corridor %s.

[108] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What is the documented structure and size of Circle’s 'Pledge 1%' equity reserve, and what published reports detail allocations to consumer safety or financial-literacy initiatives as of August 12, 2025? A: Short answer (as of August 12, 2025) - Structure & size: Circle’s S‑1 / prospectus states it “reserved 2,682,392 shares of our Class A common stock … for donations to the Circle Foundation over 10 years,” which represented ~1% of outstanding capital stock when approved by the board. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1876042/000119312525084832/d737521ds1a.htm)) - Published reports on allocations: Circle’s public materials (the S‑1/prospectus and Circle Impact report) describe the Foundation / impact programs and case studies (e.g., Unlocking Impact winners) but do not publish a line‑item breakdown or dollar amounts specifically earmarked to “consumer safety” or “financial‑literacy” from the pledged equity as of Aug 12, 2025. The Q2‑2025 earnings/press release likewise notes the reserved shares but not allocation detail. ([circle.com](https://www.circle.com/en/circle-impact-report), [sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1876042/000162828025039749/q22025epr.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can (a) pull the exact S‑1 prospectus pages as PDFs or (b) monitor future filings/Impact reports for any published allocation statements.

[109] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What public disclosures has Circle made as of August 12, 2025 regarding consumer-protection standards for Circle Payments Network and Circle Gateway, including refund/recourse windows, misdirected-payment mitigation, and any fee caps, and where are these policies documented? A: Short answer (as of Aug 12, 2025): - Circle Payments Network (CPN): Circle says CPN is a governed network operator (it does not hold or move customer fiat) and that consumer-facing refund/recourse, dispute SLAs and misdirected‑payment handling are implemented by the participating financial institutions and the CPN Rules / Participation Agreement (CPN Rules include SLAs and dispute-resolution provisions). Circle’s public pages describe the governance model but do not publish detailed consumer recourse windows or fee caps for end users — those are set in member agreements and local institution policies. ([circle.com](https://www.circle.com/cpn?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1876042/000119312525132755/d737521ds1a.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Circle Gateway: public developer docs disclose (a) fee structure — base (gas) + percentage; a promotional instant‑transfer rate of 0.005% is published; (b) Gateway is non‑custodial (users control Gateway Wallets), attestation/mint flow is onchain and effectively irreversible, and a trustless withdrawal path with a 7‑day delay exists if APIs are unavailable; (c) refunds/recourse for mistaken on‑chain sends are not guaranteed and normal on‑chain irreversibility applies — user agreements also state many Circle transactions are non‑reversible and set timeframes for reporting errors (e.g., 60 days in some consumer terms). See Gateway Fees/FAQ and Circle user agreements for exact language. ([developers.circle.com](https://developers.circle.com/gateway/references/fees?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [circle.com](https://www.circle.com/legal/user-agreement?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Where documented (public links): - CPN product & developer pages and blog (CPN Rules/Participation Agreement referenced). ([circle.com](https://www.circle.com/cpn?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - SEC disclosure (S‑1) description of CPN governance and agreements.

[110] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 12, 2025, where are the published fee schedules for Circle Payments Network, Circle Gateway, and Arc (including any volume-linked pricing, issuance/redemption fees, and FX spreads), and what are the listed rates or ranges? A: Short answer — sources and published rates as of 12 Aug 2025: - Circle Payments Network (CPN): fee architecture (Payout Fees, FX spreads, and a country‑tiered CPN Network Fee) is described on Circle’s CPN pages/developer docs, but Circle does NOT publish a public, numeric fee table for CPN (rates are negotiated/market‑priced or surfaced to onboarded OFIs/BFIs). ([developers.circle.com](https://developers.circle.com/cpn?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Circle Gateway: fees documented in the Gateway developer docs — a gas/base fee + a percentage‑based fee; promotional instant cross‑chain rate 0.005% (0.00005) is stated; live/volume pricing is dynamic and retrievable via the Gateway API. ([developers.circle.com](https://developers.circle.com/gateway/references/fees?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Minting/redemption (Circle Mint): published in Circle’s SEC filing — minting generally free; basic redemption free; standard redemption tiers: 0.03% ($2M–$5M), 0.06% ($5M–$15M), 0.10% (>$15M). FX spreads are corridor/market dependent and not fixed in public materials.

[111] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: Have Brazil’s Banco Central do Brasil (BACEN), Mexico’s Banxico or CNBV, or Nigeria’s Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) issued public guidance or rules on whether stablecoin-based payment-versus-payment foreign exchange (such as via Circle Arc or Circle Payments Network) constitutes regulated FX dealing or payment services, and what licensing, reporting, price-band, or capital-control constraints would apply, as of August 12, 2025? Please cite documents. A: Short answer — yes, but with different statuses: - Brazil: the Central Bank opened a public consultation (Consulta Pública nº111/2024) proposing to treat cross‑border stable‑coin operations by PSAVs as activities in the foreign‑exchange market (authorization + reporting, capital/operational requirements and transaction limits are in the draft). (BCB consulta pública). ([gov.br](https://www.gov.br/participamaisbrasil/consulta-publica-n-111?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Mexico: Banxico/SHCP/CNBV’s joint communiqué (No.039/2021) reiterates that virtual assets (including stablecoins) are not legal tender and that financial institutions may not offer public operations with them absent specific authorisation — no Mexico‑wide, explicit PvP/“stablecoin = FX dealer” rule beyond those existing prohibitions/authorization requirements was published by Aug 12, 2025. ([gob.mx](https://www.gob.mx/shcp/prensa/banco-de-mexico-shcp-y-cnbv-advierten-sobre-riesgos-de-utilizar-activos-virtuales-275819?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [banxico.org.mx](https://www.banxico.org.mx/sistemas-de-pago/6--acciones-regulatorias-po.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Nigeria: the CBN issued circular FPR/DIR/PUB/CIR/002/003 (Guidelines on operation of bank accounts for VASPs, 22‑Dec‑2023) — banks may open designated/settlement accounts for SEC‑licensed VASPs but those accounts are restricted (Naira‑only settlement, no cash/cheque withdrawals, T+3 settlement, monthly reporting, high collateral requirements, limits on transfers and explicit prohibitions on banks holding crypto on own account). These rules effectively constrain stablecoin‑based FX/payment flows. ([scribd.com](https://www.scribd.com/document/698232794/Guidelines-on-Operations-of-Bank-Accounts-for-Virtual-Asset-Providers?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [eucd1-acas.dentons.com](https://eucd1-acas.dentons.com/en/insights/newsletters/2024/january/31/dentons-acas-law-financial-services-newsletter/dentons-acas-law-financial-services-newsletter-january-2024/a-new-era-for-the-operation-of-bank-accounts-for-virtual-assets-service-providers-in-nigeria?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can pull the exact draft articles/paragraphs (Brazil) or quote the CBN circular text and page references.

[112] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: According to the Circle Arc litepaper, what are the stated validator eligibility and KYC obligations and the approach to privacy and Travel Rule enforcement? Please quote the relevant passages and provide the litepaper’s publication date and URL. A: Short answer — direct quotes from the Arc litepaper (publication date and URL below): - Validator eligibility (quote): "Arc will rely on a permissioned, Proof-of‑Authority (PoA) validator set composed of a limited number of known, established, and geographically distributed institutions held to high standards of accountability and operational guarantees.2" Footnote: "Validator selection criteria include but are not limited to: proven history of operational resilience, uptime guarantees, regulatory compliance, and security practices." ([6778953.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net](https://6778953.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/6778953/Arc%20Litepaper%20-%202025.pdf)) - Privacy / Travel Rule (quote): "The opt‑in features allow for selective disclosure through mechanisms like 'view keys'... Furthermore, an institution always retains full visibility into the transactions conducted by its own customers, including up and down‑stream transactions, which is essential for regulatory obligations like transaction monitoring and the Travel Rule." ([6778953.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net](https://6778953.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/6778953/Arc%20Litepaper%20-%202025.pdf)) Publication date: August 2025.

<a id="post-118"></a>
[118] **Global Macro Strategist** [Strength] GENIUS Act codifies payment stablecoins as non‑securities and bans interest, creating a clean two‑track set: USDC as regulatory‑safe digital cash and USYC for yield/collateral. This reduces legal frictions for banks/brokers/treasurers, likely accelerating institutional onboarding and deepening USDC liquidity—supporting volume‑linked fees (Gateway/CPN/ARC) even if rates fall. | Falsifier: Final rules narrow carve‑out or curb USYC collateral use {Conf: Med}

<a id="post-119"></a>
[119] **Independent Market Skeptic & Columnist** [Risk] Genius Act’s ban on paying interest to stablecoin holders is a corporate‑treasury adoption headwind: enterprises expect yield on operational cash, but auto‑sweeping USDC into USYC likely requires segregated wallets, suitability/ECP gating, and retail exclusions—driving either lower USDC working balances (shrinking reserve income) or richer partner incentives to hold float, pressuring RLDC.

[121] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: Where do Circle’s public Circle Gateway technical or security documents describe a non-custodial operating model and a trustless seven-day withdrawal path, and what exact steps and time guarantees are specified? Please provide URLs and verbatim excerpts, as of August 12, 2025. A: Short answer & sources (as of Aug 12, 2025): URLs - Gateway Technical Guide: https://developers.circle.com/gateway/explanation/technical-guide. ([developers.circle.com](https://developers.circle.com/gateway/explanation/technical-guide?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Gateway FAQ: https://developers.circle.com/gateway/explanation/faq. ([developers.circle.com](https://developers.circle.com/gateway/explanation/faq?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Contract interfaces (initiateWithdrawal / withdrawalDelay): https://developers.circle.com/gateway/references/contract-interfaces-and-events. ([developers.circle.com](https://developers.circle.com/gateway/references/contract-interfaces-and-events?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Verbatim excerpts (≤25 words each) - "The contract is non-custodial, meaning users always have full control over their USDC." ([developers.circle.com](https://developers.circle.com/gateway/explanation/technical-guide?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - "After a delay of 7 days, make a contract call to the withdraw method to complete the withdrawal." ([developers.circle.com](https://developers.circle.com/gateway/explanation/technical-guide?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - "After `withdrawalDelay` blocks, withdraw can be called to complete the withdrawal." ([developers.circle.com](https://developers.circle.com/gateway/references/contract-interfaces-and-events?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Exact steps & time guarantees (paraphrase) 1) Call Gateway Wallet contract: initiateWithdrawal(token, amount). This removes that amount from usable balance and sets a withdrawalBlock/withdrawalDelay. ([developers.circle.com](https://developers.circle.com/gateway/references/contract-interfaces-and-events?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) 2) Wait the configured delay (documented as seven days / `withdrawalDelay` blocks). ([developers.circle.com](https://developers.circle.com/gateway/explanation/technical-guide?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) 3) Call withdraw() on the wallet contract to complete and receive on‑chain USDC. Repeated initiateWithdrawal calls add to the amount and reset the timer. ([developers.circle.com](https://developers.circle.com/gateway/references/contract-interfaces-and-events?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can fetch the exact contract ABI lines (initiateWithdrawal/withdraw) and snapshot them verbatim.

[122] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: Has Circle published partner UX standards or brand guidelines that require differentiating USDC from USYC in user interfaces (for example, distinct icons/tickers, default spend blocks on USYC, and explicit opt-in for conversions), and if so, where are these requirements documented as of August 12, 2025? A: Short answer: Yes (partly). - Circle’s Brand Kit explicitly publishes separate token logos and usage rules for USDC and USYC (distinct token icons/colors and clearspace/size rules). ([circle.com](https://www.circle.com/en/pressroom)) - Circle’s developer docs show confirmation UIs include token symbol/name and its SDKs expose UI customization, and the USYC Quickstart shows subscribe/redeem are explicit contract calls (i.e., conversions require an explicit transaction). ([developers.circle.com](https://developers.circle.com/w3s/docs/confirmation-uis?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) What I could not find (as of Aug 12, 2025): a published Circle partner UX policy that mandates specific behavioral UX rules such as “default spend blocks on USYC” or a required explicit opt‑in UI pattern for conversions. That may exist in partner agreements or private integration docs — contact Circle partner support for any mandatory partner-only UX requirements.

<a id="post-123"></a>
[123] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: Has Circle published a GAAP accounting policy memorandum or guide for enterprises covering USDC and USYC treatment (including revenue recognition, gas-fee expense classification, and FX gains/losses), and if so, what are the document title, publication date, and URL? A: Short answer: No — I could not find a publicly posted, enterprise‑targeted "GAAP accounting policy memorandum" from Circle that prescribes USDC/USYC GAAP treatment (revenue recognition, gas‑fee classification, FX gains/losses) as of Aug 12, 2025. Instead, Circle has related public materials (policy/whitepaper, blog posts, SEC filings) but states it does not provide accounting advice. ([circle.com](https://www.circle.com/en/legal/mica-usdc-whitepaper?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Relevant Circle publications (examples): - "USDC White Paper" — published/posted May 31, 2024. ([circle.com](https://www.circle.com/en/legal/mica-usdc-whitepaper?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Blog: "Circle Responds to the FASB’s Invitation to Comment on its 2025 Agenda Consultation" — posted July 2, 2025. ([circle.com](https://www.circle.com/blog/circle-responds-to-the-fasbs-invitation-to-comment-on-its-2025-agenda-consultation?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you’d like, I can (a) search Circle’s investor/press/ legal archives more deeply, (b) search third‑party accounting firms for a Circle‑branded memo, or (c.1) contact Circle support guidance pages and return any direct URL they provide. Which do you prefer?

[124] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: Under the EU MiCA and e-money frameworks, have the European Commission, ESMA, EBA, or any national competent authority published guidance on whether charging network fees in an e-money token such as USDC on a proprietary Layer-1 (e.g., Circle Arc) requires authorization beyond e-money issuance (such as CASP permissions), and what specific licensing or conduct obligations would apply? Please cite official documents, as of August 12, 2025. A: Short answer — yes, but only via the EBA’s June 10, 2025 Opinion; MiCA itself sets the baseline. The EBA’s “No‑Action” Opinion (EBA/Op/2025/08) says EMT issuers must be authorised as an electronic‑money institution (per MiCA) but that certain EMT activities (custody/administration of EMTs or transfers on behalf of clients) can qualify as payment services and therefore may trigger PSD2/PSR PSP authorisation — however NCAs were advised to allow a transition period (authorisation not prioritised until early March 2026) and to deprioritise some PSD2 obligations (e.g., pre‑contractual exact fee disclosure for unpredictable on‑chain “gas” fees). MiCA itself requires EMT issuers to hold EMI/credit‑institution authorisation and to disclose applicable fees/incentive mechanisms in the white paper; it also bars fees on redemption in specified cases. National NCAs have published general MiCA implementation material (e.g. BaFin, ACPR/Circle white papers) but no single additional EU‑level binding clarification on “network fees on a proprietary L1” beyond the EBA opinion as of 12 Aug 2025. ([eba.europa.eu](https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-06/e2958c99-a1b0-4b07-9d31-bcba0a28dbe7/Opinion%20on%20the%20interplay%20between%20PSD2%20and%20MiCA.pdf), [eur-lex.europa.eu](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1114/2024-01-09/eng?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [bafin.de](https://www.bafin.de/EN/Aufsicht/MiCAR/MiCAR_node_en.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

[125] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: Have any U.S. regulators (such as the SEC, OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, CFPB, or FinCEN) issued public guidance on the permissibility and required controls for automated sweeps from USDC into yield-bearing USYC for corporate treasurers, including Eligible Contract Participant gating, suitability, and retail-user exclusions? Please provide citations, as of August 12, 2025. A: Short answer: No — as of Aug 12, 2025, I found no public guidance from the SEC, OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, CFPB, or FinCEN that specifically prescribes permissibility or required controls for automated corporate-treasury sweeps from USDC into Circle’s USYC (e.g., mandatory ECP‑gating, formal “suitability” rules, or retail‑user exclusion rules). Regulators have issued broader crypto/stablecoin and custodial risk guidance (and rescinded some prior pre‑approval letters), but not sweep‑specific rules. ([occ.treas.gov](https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2025/nr-occ-2025-16.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-stablecoins-040425?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [fdic.gov](https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2025/agencies-issue-joint-statement-risk-management-considerations-crypto-asset?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Key references (illustrative): - OCC Interpretive Letter re: crypto custody/stablecoin activities (March 7, 2025). ([occ.treas.gov](https://www.occ.treas.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2025/nr-occ-2025-16.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - SEC Division statement on “Covered Stablecoins” (April 4, 2025) — explicitly does not address yield‑bearing stablecoins. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/statement-stablecoins-040425?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Interagency risk‑management statement on crypto‑asset safekeeping (July 14, 2025). ([fdic.gov](https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2025/agencies-issue-joint-statement-risk-management-considerations-crypto-asset?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can pull any agency webpages or search for agency comment letters or enforcement actions mentioning automated sweep programs.

[126] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: Where are the official NetSuite and SAP connectors or integrations for Circle Gateway documented, and what supported functions (such as issuance/redemption, payables, receivables, and reconciliation) and certification statuses are listed as of August 12, 2025? A: Short answer — official Circle Gateway docs and what they list, and where NetSuite/SAP connectors stand (as of 2025‑08‑12): - Circle Gateway official docs: Circle’s Gateway overview and Technical Guide (developer docs). ([developers.circle.com](https://developers.circle.com/gateway?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - What Gateway documents as supported: deposits → unified USDC balance, attestation API to mint on destination chains (issuance/instant transfer), burns/withdrawals (redemption), balance and events endpoints that enable on‑chain traceability (used for reconciliation). No ERP/AP/AR posting semantics are documented in Circle’s Gateway docs — those are left to integrators using Circle’s APIs. ([developers.circle.com](https://developers.circle.com/gateway/explanation/technical-guide?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - NetSuite / SAP connectors status: I could not find any official Circle Gateway connectors published on Circle’s developer site, NetSuite’s SuiteApp/payment‑gateway listings, or SAP’s marketplace as of 2025‑08‑12; integrations are therefore typically built via Circle’s APIs or via middleware/iPaaS (Celigo, Boomi, Workato, etc.). For NetSuite gateway/integration mechanics see NetSuite payment‑gateway docs. ([docs.oracle.com](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/bridgehead_N1566955.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [developers.circle.com](https://developers.circle.com/gateway?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can (A) search NetSuite SuiteApp and SAP App Center again for any newly‑published partner connectors, or (B) map the concrete ERP flows you need (AP/AR/reconciliation) to the exact Circle API endpoints and an integration approach.

[127] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What consumer refund, revocation, or chargeback windows and procedures are mandated under Banco Central do Brasil’s Pix regulations, including Pix Mediation (Pix MED), and what escrow or prefunding obligations apply to participating payment service providers? Please cite the relevant circulars, resolutions, or manuals. A: Short answer — key mandated windows/procedures and liquidity rules: - Mecanismo Especial de Devolução (MED): refunds may be initiated within 90 days of the original Pix (Res. BCB nº 103/2021, Art.41‑A). MED requires a DICT “notificação de infração”; accepted notifications trigger immediate blocking of available funds in the receiver’s transacional account; multiple partial blocks/devolutions are allowed until the amount is satisfied or 90 days; the receiver may seek cancellation within 30 days. ([lefisc.com.br](https://www.lefisc.com.br/banco/2021/resolucaoBCB103_21.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [bcb.gov.br](https://www.bcb.gov.br/content/estabilidadefinanceira/pix/API-DICT.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Bloqueio cautelar: PSP receiving funds must (on suspicion) block funds simultaneously with credit for up to 72 hours while investigating; if fraud is confirmed, MED flow is used. ([taxpratico.com.br](https://www.taxpratico.com.br/pagina/resolucao-bcb-n-147-de-28-de-setembro-de-2021?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Operational timings in the DICT Manual/API: counterparties typically have 7 calendar days to analyse an infraction notification; payer‑side PSPs have operational windows (e.g. 72h to act in certain flows) specified in the DICT Manual/API. ([bcb.gov.br](https://www.bcb.gov.br/content/estabilidadefinanceira/pix/API-DICT.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Escrow / prefunding: there is no general “escrow” obligation for PSPs — Pix settlement is by Conta PI in the SPI; the BCB offers provimento de liquidez to Conta PI holders and private liquidity mechanisms (chambers/liquidantes) may be used (Res. BCB nº 1 / Regulamento do SPI; Res. 195/2022; Arts.43–44). For Pix Automático Res. 402/2024 requires the payer’s PSP to reimburse from its own resources in certain errors (timeframe to be set by the BCB). ([editoraroncarati.com.br](https://www.editoraroncarati.com.br/v2/Diario-Oficial/Diario-Oficial/RESOLUCAO-BCB-N%C2%BA-001-DE-12-08-12-2020.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can extract the exact article text and DICT‑manual paragraphs and deliver direct citations (PDF/DOU) for each point.

[128] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: According to the Circle Arc litepaper and public technical documentation, what consensus algorithm does Circle Arc implement, and what deterministic finality time (in seconds) is specified? Please provide exact quoted passages and URLs, as of August 12, 2025. A: Short answer — per Circle’s materials: Arc uses the Malachite (Tendermint-derived) BFT consensus and the litepaper specifies sub‑second deterministic finality (examples: 350 ms = 0.35 s with 20 validators; 100 ms = 0.10 s with 4 validators). Exact quoted passages and sources (as of 2025‑08‑12): - From the Arc litepaper summary quoted by CryptoSlate: “According to the blockchain network’s litepaper, Arc’s performance targets include 3,000 transactions per second (TPS) with under 350 milliseconds finality using 20 validators. Notably, the network could reach 10,000 TPS and under 100 milliseconds of finality with four validators.” ([cryptoslate.com](https://cryptoslate.com/circle-to-launch-l1-blockchain-called-arc-sparking-concerns-over-centralization-and-governance/)) - From Circle technical coverage (CoinCentral): “At the core of Arc is Malachite, a high‑performance consensus engine developed by Informal Systems. … Its architecture supports deterministic sub‑second confirmation times, which is crucial for capital market operations.” ([coincentral.com](https://coincentral.com/circle-introduces-arc-to-power-the-next-era-of-stablecoin-payments/)) - From the Malachite public repo (Informal Systems): “Bundled with Malachite comes a state‑of‑the‑art implementation of the Tendermint BFT consensus algorithm.” (also noting experimental finalization numbers in the repo). ([github.com](https://github.com/informalsystems/malachite?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can fetch the Arc litepaper PDF link itself and paste the exact PDF URL.
