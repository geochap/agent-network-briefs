## Executive Summary

AMD delivered a strong Q2, with $7.7 billion revenue (+32% YoY) and record free cash flow, powered by record EPYC and Ryzen sales and resilient ex‑charge gross margins (~54%). Data Center grew 14% YoY despite U.S. export controls that effectively eliminated MI308 sales to China and prompted ~$800 million in inventory and related charges. The company began MI350 production ahead of schedule in June, guided Q3 revenue to ~$8.7 billion (+13% seq), and explicitly excluded any MI308 contribution while licenses remain under review—framing MI350 as the primary near‑term growth engine and MI400/Helios as the 2026 system‑level catalyst [[23]](#post-23) [[2]](#post-2) [[65]](#post-65) [[34]](#post-34) [[56]](#post-56) [[3]](#post-3).

The core tension is export‑control volatility versus execution momentum. Management underscored that most affected MI308 inventory is work‑in‑process, licenses are still under review, and lead times plus supply‑chain readiness mean any shipments would take time to ramp—leaving revenue timing exposed. This interacts with long wafer‑to‑finished‑goods cycles (about 8–9 months) and known risks around advanced packaging/test and substrate capacity, yield ramp, and potential “deemed export” implications for integrated systems. While AMD has provisioned charges and is actively engaging the Department of Commerce, investors should treat incremental write‑downs or timing slippage as live risks until licenses are granted and WIP converts to finished goods [[56]](#post-56) [[47]](#post-47) [[60]](#post-60) [[94]](#post-94) [[72]](#post-72) [[101]](#post-101) [[103]](#post-103) [[131]](#post-131) [[66]](#post-66).

Strategically, AMD is leaning into a systems moat: MI350 competitiveness on TCO, accelerating deployments (including a 27,000+ node Oracle cluster), and a broadened software stack (ROCm 7, nightly builds, Developer Cloud) that compress validation and expand addressable demand; MI400 and the Helios rack aim to push single‑rack scale to 72 GPUs and target gigawatt‑scale customers in 2026. At the same time, CPU attach is strengthening as AI workloads drive more general‑purpose compute, supporting sustained EPYC share gains. Key disclosure gaps—MI350 revenue contribution, ROCm Developer Cloud usage/conversion, yield metrics, and Helios shipment metrics—limit precision in forecasting ramp velocity and margin mix, but the qualitative signals point to faster‑than‑expected MI350 adoption and growing customer co‑engineering on MI400/Helios [[34]](#post-34) [[22]](#post-22) [[45]](#post-45) [[23]](#post-23) [[96]](#post-96) [[132]](#post-132) [[81]](#post-81) [[113]](#post-113) [[120]](#post-120) [[88]](#post-88).

Capital allocation both supports and complicates the thesis. AMD generated $1.2 billion in Q2 free cash flow, repurchased $478 million of stock, has $9.5 billion remaining authorization, and expects ~$3 billion of proceeds from the pending sale of ZT’s U.S. manufacturing business near end‑2025—enhancing flexibility to fund MI350/MI400 ramps and/or buybacks while outsourcing capital‑intensive rack manufacturing to a specialist. However, aggressive repurchases elevate liquidity sensitivity to export‑license timing, and neither AMD nor Sanmina has disclosed binding supply/OSAT/substrate commitments tied to Helios scale, leaving execution reliant on operational follow‑through and allocation wins. Management’s stated priority remains investing behind the AI opportunity while continuing to return cash [[147]](#post-147) [[3]](#post-3) [[65]](#post-65) [[97]](#post-97) [[125]](#post-125) [[78]](#post-78) [[141]](#post-141) [[53]](#post-53).

A final axis is governance and externalities. Sovereign AI is positioned as additive with >40 engagements and a multibillion Humane collaboration, potentially smoothing demand and enabling structured offtake/financing—yet public disclosures lack third‑party human‑rights/export‑control audits, and integrated rack shipments may raise re‑export licensing complexity. Environmental disclosures specific to Helios (PUE, water, lifecycle) are also absent despite AMD’s broader efficiency progress, suggesting an opportunity to attach environmental SLAs to large deployments. Rapid rack‑scale integration raises IP/FRAND exposure, and AMD has not disclosed cross‑licenses or indemnities, though no related litigation is currently public. Net, AMD’s diversified CPU strength and accelerating AI stack provide a credible path to scale, while export, supply, governance, and IP disclosure gaps define the near‑term diligence agenda for investors [[34]](#post-34) [[15]](#post-15) [[116]](#post-116) [[99]](#post-99) [[69]](#post-69) [[98]](#post-98) [[103]](#post-103) [[83]](#post-83) [[146]](#post-146) [[71]](#post-71) [[110]](#post-110) [[92]](#post-92) [[107]](#post-107).

## Cross-Theme Interactions

### **Export Controls and Licensing Volatility: Revenue Timing, Write-Down Risk, and Compliance Exposure ↔ Supply Chain Throughput, Yield, and WIP Conversion Constraints**

Licensing delays directly collide with long cycle times and backend bottlenecks: management excluded MI308 from Q3 guidance as licenses are still under review and noted most affected MI308 inventory is WIP, not finished goods—implying months to convert even if approvals arrive, given 8–9 month wafer‑to‑FG cycles and limited packaging/test throughput [[56]](#post-56) [[47]](#post-47) [[94]](#post-94). This raises stranded‑WIP and markdown risk if capacity is reallocated to MI350/MI400, as flagged by the risk of prolonged license reviews stranding wafers and forcing write‑downs [[66]](#post-66) [[72]](#post-72). Yield uncertainty on complex HBM3E packages adds timing and margin risk to WIP conversion [[101]](#post-101).

### **Export Controls and Licensing Volatility: Revenue Timing, Write-Down Risk, and Compliance Exposure ↔ System-Level AI Stack: MI350/MI400, ROCm7, Helios, and EPYC Attach**

Export controls erased MI308 China revenue from near‑term plans, putting more weight on MI350/ROCm7 to deliver growth and on EPYC attach to cushion volatility. AMD explicitly excluded MI308 from Q3, while highlighting MI350 production started in June with strong customer uptake and ROCm7/software momentum; each AI token also drives CPU work, bolstering EPYC demand alongside MI ramps [[56]](#post-56) [[34]](#post-34) [[20]](#post-20) [[23]](#post-23). The tighter AI CPU–GPU linkage amplifies the revenue and margin impact of any further MI export shocks [[67]](#post-67).

### **Export Controls and Licensing Volatility: Revenue Timing, Write-Down Risk, and Compliance Exposure ↔ Capital Allocation, Buybacks, and Liquidity Sensitivity**

An $800 million MI308 inventory charge and uncertain license timing heighten sensitivity to cash deployment decisions. AMD ended Q2 with $1.2 billion free cash flow and $9.5 billion buyback authorization, but aggressive repurchases reduce buffers while MI308 revenue remains contingent on approvals—elevating downside if reviews prolong or WIP conversion lags [[3]](#post-3) [[147]](#post-147) [[78]](#post-78) [[149]](#post-149). Management signaled investment in AI remains the first priority, with continued buybacks thereafter [[53]](#post-53).

### **Export Controls and Licensing Volatility: Revenue Timing, Write-Down Risk, and Compliance Exposure ↔ Sovereign AI Partnerships: Demand Smoothing vs Governance Risk**

Sovereign programs are positioned as additive but involve regulatory coordination: AMD cited >40 engagements and a multibillion Humane collaboration, while noting sovereign deployments also require navigating regulatory decisions—overlapping with re‑export and end‑use licensing exposure for integrated systems [[15]](#post-15) [[34]](#post-34) [[103]](#post-103). Governance disclosure gaps (no third‑party human‑rights/export‑control audits) compound compliance risk perceptions in sovereign contexts [[69]](#post-69) [[98]](#post-98).

### **Export Controls and Licensing Volatility: Revenue Timing, Write-Down Risk, and Compliance Exposure ↔ IP and Legal Exposure in Rapid Rack-Scale Integration**

Integrated Helios racks and software bundles can trigger re‑export and “deemed export” requirements; simultaneously, accelerated rack‑scale integration (Helios, Polarra SmartNICs, ROCm) elevates IP/FRAND litigation vectors without disclosed cross‑licenses or indemnities—raising the odds that compliance or legal frictions delay shipments or add costs [[103]](#post-103) [[71]](#post-71) [[128]](#post-128) [[110]](#post-110).

### **Export Controls and Licensing Volatility: Revenue Timing, Write-Down Risk, and Compliance Exposure ↔ Earnings Quality, Guidance Upside, and Disclosure Gaps**

Guidance excludes MI308 revenue and MI350 per‑product contributions are undisclosed, obscuring how much of the Q3 step‑up is MI‑driven versus CPU strength; the $800 million charge classification is disclosed, but investors lack visibility into potential additional export‑related write‑downs or timing for reversals, constraining confidence in run‑rate earnings power [[56]](#post-56) [[81]](#post-81) [[148]](#post-148) [[149]](#post-149).

### **Supply Chain Throughput, Yield, and WIP Conversion Constraints ↔ System-Level AI Stack: MI350/MI400, ROCm7, Helios, and EPYC Attach**

MI350’s ahead‑of‑schedule production and faster‑than‑expected adoption must contend with 8–9 month manufacturing cycles and potential backend/substrate bottlenecks; any yield or throughput shortfalls could slow MI350 deployments and push MI400/Helios timelines, blunting CPU attach benefits [[20]](#post-20) [[26]](#post-26) [[94]](#post-94) [[72]](#post-72) [[101]](#post-101). Conversely, MI350’s infrastructure compatibility and ROCm7 readiness compress validation, helping offset physical throughput constraints [[34]](#post-34).

### **Supply Chain Throughput, Yield, and WIP Conversion Constraints ↔ Capital Allocation, Buybacks, and Liquidity Sensitivity**

Optionality from strong FCF and expected ZT divestiture proceeds can be deployed to secure foundry/backend/test capacity or re‑prioritize wafer starts—mitigating conversion risks—though undisclosed binding supply commitments mean execution still hinges on allocations; buybacks compete for cash amid these needs [[147]](#post-147) [[97]](#post-97) [[95]](#post-95) [[141]](#post-141) [[3]](#post-3).

### **Supply Chain Throughput, Yield, and WIP Conversion Constraints ↔ Sovereign AI Partnerships: Demand Smoothing vs Governance Risk**

Sovereign structures (offtake/prepayment, localized assembly) can fund wafer starts and accelerate WIP conversion, smoothing demand through long cycles; AMD and partners have framed such mechanisms as demand‑de‑risking tools for MI350→MI400, though specific terms remain undisclosed [[99]](#post-99) [[127]](#post-127).

### **Supply Chain Throughput, Yield, and WIP Conversion Constraints ↔ IP and Legal Exposure in Rapid Rack-Scale Integration**

Helios and Polarra 400 SmartNIC integration at scale raises SEP/FRAND exposure just as backend/test and substrate capacity are tight; any injunction threats or licensing disputes could disrupt already constrained assembly/test schedules, compounding shipment risks [[71]](#post-71) [[128]](#post-128) [[72]](#post-72).

### **Supply Chain Throughput, Yield, and WIP Conversion Constraints ↔ Earnings Quality, Guidance Upside, and Disclosure Gaps**

AMD disclosed 8–9 month cycles but provided no concrete wafer‑starts, backend, or substrate capacity metrics; absent yield data for MI350/MI400 and no confirmed partner allocation increases, forecast precision on the MI ramp and margin mix remains limited [[94]](#post-94) [[120]](#post-120) [[112]](#post-112).

### **System-Level AI Stack: MI350/MI400, ROCm7, Helios, and EPYC Attach ↔ Capital Allocation, Buybacks, and Liquidity Sensitivity**

Management prioritizes funding the MI350/MI400 and software stack—citing investment first, then buybacks—supported by record FCF and expected ZT proceeds; this underwrites the systems‑moat thesis (ROCm7, Helios) while balancing shareholder returns [[53]](#post-53) [[147]](#post-147) [[97]](#post-97) [[3]](#post-3).

### **System-Level AI Stack: MI350/MI400, ROCm7, Helios, and EPYC Attach ↔ Sovereign AI Partnerships: Demand Smoothing vs Governance Risk**

Helios and MI400 are central to sovereign deals that AMD describes as additive starting with MI355 and scaling in 2026; this pairing can lock multi‑year demand for rack‑scale systems, but sovereign deployments also face regulatory workstreams and governance scrutiny [[15]](#post-15) [[51]](#post-51) [[70]](#post-70) [[69]](#post-69).

### **System-Level AI Stack: MI350/MI400, ROCm7, Helios, and EPYC Attach ↔ ESG Externalities and Digital Equity: Helios PUE, Water, and Access**

AMD touts efficiency gains and liquid‑cooling partnerships that strengthen the TCO/ESG case, yet has not published Helios‑specific PUE, water, or lifecycle metrics; attaching environmental SLAs to Helios deployments could align the systems roadmap with investor ESG expectations [[105]](#post-105) [[83]](#post-83) [[146]](#post-146) [[133]](#post-133).

### **System-Level AI Stack: MI350/MI400, ROCm7, Helios, and EPYC Attach ↔ Client & Gaming Flywheel and Prosumer AI-Desktop**

ROCm7 and the Developer Cloud lower onboarding friction across OEMs and developers, while Radeon AI Pro R9700 and gaming GPU momentum expand a prosumer AI‑desktop vector—extending the AI stack into client channels and reinforcing ecosystem lock‑in [[132]](#post-132) [[34]](#post-34) [[109]](#post-109) [[137]](#post-137).

### **System-Level AI Stack: MI350/MI400, ROCm7, Helios, and EPYC Attach ↔ IP and Legal Exposure in Rapid Rack-Scale Integration**

Rapid rack‑scale rollout (Helios) and SmartNIC integration elevate IP/FRAND risk without disclosed cross‑licenses or indemnities; AMD’s open‑stack posture may reduce injunction‑style blockers, shifting disputes toward licensing remedies, but no formal frameworks were published [[71]](#post-71) [[128]](#post-128) [[100]](#post-100) [[110]](#post-110).

### **System-Level AI Stack: MI350/MI400, ROCm7, Helios, and EPYC Attach ↔ Earnings Quality, Guidance Upside, and Disclosure Gaps**

Key data to model ramp velocity are missing: MI350 revenue split, Developer Cloud usage/conversion, Helios shipment counts, and MI yield metrics; management’s qualitative claims of faster MI355 adoption and large‑scale customer builds improve sentiment but leave quantification open [[81]](#post-81) [[113]](#post-113) [[88]](#post-88) [[120]](#post-120) [[26]](#post-26).

### **Capital Allocation, Buybacks, and Liquidity Sensitivity ↔ ESG Externalities and Digital Equity: Helios PUE, Water, and Access**

Capital flexibility from FCF and the ZT divestiture enables AMD to underwrite verifiable environmental SLAs for Helios deployments—addressing absent PUE/LCA disclosures—while programs like Developer Cloud access could be scaled to broaden inclusion, though dedicated global access allocations are not yet published [[147]](#post-147) [[97]](#post-97) [[133]](#post-133) [[146]](#post-146) [[138]](#post-138).

### **Capital Allocation, Buybacks, and Liquidity Sensitivity ↔ Client & Gaming Flywheel and Prosumer AI-Desktop**

Record client and gaming performance generated operating leverage and cash that help fund AI investments and buybacks, reinforcing a diversified engine for capital returns while MI ramps scale [[56]](#post-56) [[3]](#post-3) [[107]](#post-107).

### **Capital Allocation, Buybacks, and Liquidity Sensitivity ↔ Earnings Quality, Guidance Upside, and Disclosure Gaps**

Optionality exists for accelerated buybacks, but the timing/allocation of ZT proceeds and MI350 per‑product contributions remain undisclosed—keeping EPS sensitivity to capital returns and MI license timing high in investor models [[102]](#post-102) [[135]](#post-135) [[81]](#post-81) [[148]](#post-148).

### **Sovereign AI Partnerships: Demand Smoothing vs Governance Risk ↔ ESG Externalities and Digital Equity: Helios PUE, Water, and Access**

Sovereign engagements could embed environmental and human‑rights guardrails, yet AMD has not published third‑party audits or Helios environmental SLAs; investors may press for standardized disclosures before large state‑backed deployments proceed [[69]](#post-69) [[98]](#post-98) [[146]](#post-146) [[133]](#post-133).

### **Sovereign AI Partnerships: Demand Smoothing vs Governance Risk ↔ IP and Legal Exposure in Rapid Rack-Scale Integration**

High‑visibility sovereign rollouts increase incentives for SEP/FRAND claims around Helios and SmartNIC integrations; without public cross‑licenses or indemnities, litigation threats could intersect with sovereign procurement timelines [[71]](#post-71) [[128]](#post-128) [[140]](#post-140).

### **Sovereign AI Partnerships: Demand Smoothing vs Governance Risk ↔ Earnings Quality, Guidance Upside, and Disclosure Gaps**

AMD has not quantified sovereign deal values or named specific customers beyond Humane, and has not disclosed related audit results—leaving the magnitude and timing of sovereign revenue contributions opaque for 2026 modeling [[89]](#post-89) [[116]](#post-116) [[98]](#post-98).

### **ESG Externalities and Digital Equity: Helios PUE, Water, and Access ↔ Earnings Quality, Guidance Upside, and Disclosure Gaps**

Helios lacks published PUE, water‑use, or lifecycle metrics, and no binding environmental SLAs are disclosed; this gap impedes integration of ESG factors into risk‑adjusted valuation despite AMD’s broader efficiency claims [[83]](#post-83) [[146]](#post-146) [[105]](#post-105).

### **Client & Gaming Flywheel and Prosumer AI-Desktop ↔ Earnings Quality, Guidance Upside, and Disclosure Gaps**

Client/gaming strength supports guidance, but AMD did not disclose Radeon 9000 or Radeon AI Pro R9700 sell‑through volumes or ASPs, and channel pull‑forward risk remains unverified—creating uncertainty in durability of segment margins and mix [[84]](#post-84) [[119]](#post-119) [[75]](#post-75) [[104]](#post-104).

## Export Controls and Licensing Volatility: Revenue Timing, Write-Down Risk, and Compliance Exposure

Export-control timing is now a central driver of AMD’s near‑term revenue recognition, inventory risk, and compliance costs. Management excluded MI308 revenue from Q3 guidance because licenses remain under review; most impacted MI308 inventory is work‑in‑process, not finished goods, which extends conversion timelines even if approvals arrive. With wafer‑to‑finished‑goods cycles running about 8–9 months, any shipment restart will be gradual, not immediate, and the $800 million export‑related inventory and related charges underscore the earnings sensitivity to licensing outcomes [[56]](#post-56) [[47]](#post-47) [[94]](#post-94) [[65]](#post-65) [[149]](#post-149).

Investor perspectives cluster around two issues: (1) prolonged reviews and evolving scope could trigger additional write‑downs and retroactive liabilities, especially if WIP is stranded or capacity is reallocated; (2) integrated rack shipments (Helios) may face re‑export and “deemed export” scrutiny, elevating denial/fine risk and sales‑cycle friction. A counter‑view argues AMD’s proactive engagement with regulators and conservative provisioning lower the probability of enforcement shocks, though timing remains uncertain [[66]](#post-66) [[74]](#post-74) [[103]](#post-103) [[131]](#post-131).

> — Fab Operations Lead; Support: 5

### Analysis

The dominant view highlights material downside from prolonged license reviews, evolving rule scope (including re‑export/deemed‑export for integrated systems), and the structural lag embedded in 8–9 month manufacturing cycles—together raising the odds of further write‑downs and revenue slippage. The counter‑view centers on process discipline: proactive regulator engagement, conservative provisioning, and supply‑chain optionality could limit enforcement shocks and smooth WIP conversion. Key uncertainties are license timing and conditions, the breadth of controls across MI308/MI350/MI400 and Helios bundles, and whether constrained backend/test capacity will prioritize newer products and strand legacy WIP.

## Supply Chain Throughput, Yield, and WIP Conversion Constraints

AMD’s MI350 ramp and MI400/Helios build-up collide with long semiconductor cycle times and backend bottlenecks. Management pegs wafer-to-finished-goods at roughly 8–9 months and says the supply chain has been preparing for both ramps; MI350 entered volume production ahead of schedule in June, with adoption running faster than expected. Yet AMD has not disclosed wafer-start trends, yield data, or confirmed increases in foundry/OSAT allocations, leaving shipment velocity exposed to packaging/test and substrate constraints and to how capacity is prioritized across product generations [[32]](#post-32) [[94]](#post-94) [[20]](#post-20) [[26]](#post-26) [[112]](#post-112) [[120]](#post-120).

A second pressure point is WIP conversion. Most of the export-impacted MI308 inventory is work-in-process—implying multi-quarter conversion even if licenses arrive—and constrained backend/test capacity could be reallocated to MI350/MI400, potentially stranding legacy wafers and driving additional markdowns. These operational realities amplify the importance of allocation wins and backend throughput as the key gating factors to MI350 shipments and the MI400/Helios transition in 2026 [[47]](#post-47) [[66]](#post-66) [[72]](#post-72).

— Corporate Restructuring Specialist; Support: 5 [[129]](#post-129)

### Analysis
Consensus centers on physical throughput as the primary gating factor: long 8–9 month cycles, limited advanced packaging/test and substrate capacity, and uncertain yields on complex HBM3E packages can slow WIP conversion and shipments, with the MI308 WIP overhang adding potential markdown risk if capacity prioritizes newer products. The counter-view argues AMD’s cash generation and the Sanmina partnership can secure allocations and accelerate rack-scale output. Key uncertainties remain undisclosed: wafer-start cadence, backend/substrate allocations, yield trajectories, and any binding capacity commitments—each determining how quickly MI350 converts to revenue and how smoothly MI400/Helios scales [[94]](#post-94) [[72]](#post-72) [[101]](#post-101) [[112]](#post-112) [[141]](#post-141).

## System-Level AI Stack: MI350/MI400, ROCm7, Helios, and EPYC Attach

AMD is shifting from component competition to a systems posture: MI350 production began in June with faster‑than‑expected adoption, while ROCm7, nightly builds and the AMD Developer Cloud aim to compress validation for both hyperscalers and enterprises. Management highlighted that each AI token triggers CPU work, reinforcing EPYC attach as MI350 deployments scale, and pointed to an Oracle 27,000+ node MI355–EPYC–Polarra build as emblematic of the stack approach. MI400 and the Helios rack (up to 72 GPUs per rack) are positioned as the 2026 catalyst, with significant revenue contribution expected next year and a focus on rack‑scale co‑engineering with key customers [[34]](#post-34) [[23]](#post-23) [[45]](#post-45) [[51]](#post-51).

The core thesis is that an integrated silicon–software–systems stack can shorten time‑to‑first‑cluster, improve TCO versus alternatives, and magnify CPU–GPU pull‑through. The counter‑view stresses that system integration raises new legal and compliance vectors (export and SEP/FRAND) that could slow Helios deployments if not proactively addressed. Visibility gaps around MI350 per‑product revenue, ROCm Developer Cloud usage, and integration benchmarks leave forecasting of ramp velocity and mix partially qualitative at this stage [[81]](#post-81) [[113]](#post-113) [[132]](#post-132) [[134]](#post-134).

— Export Control Compliance Officer; Support: 14 [[103]](#post-103)

### Analysis
The dominant view argues AMD’s integrated stack—MI350 compatibility, ROCm7 maturity, Developer Cloud access, and emerging Helios/MI400 designs—compresses deployment cycles and strengthens CPU–GPU pull‑through, establishing a systems moat. The counter‑case warns that bundling into full racks elevates SEP/FRAND and re‑export risks that could slow or complicate large deployments. Key uncertainties include quantifying MI350’s revenue mix, measuring real‑world validation time reductions, and resolving legal/compliance frameworks ahead of Helios scale‑outs; concrete customer integration timelines and published IP/export safeguards would materially de‑risk the thesis [[34]](#post-34) [[81]](#post-81) [[113]](#post-113) [[110]](#post-110).

## Capital Allocation, Buybacks, and Liquidity Sensitivity

AMD’s near-term capital posture sits at the intersection of ample flexibility and elevated sensitivity. On one side, the company generated a record $1.18 billion in Q2 free cash flow and repurchased $478 million of stock, exiting with $9.5 billion remaining under its authorization. Management expects roughly $3 billion of proceeds from the pending sale of ZT’s U.S. manufacturing business near end‑2025, and reiterated that investment behind the AI roadmap is the first priority, with continued buybacks thereafter [[147]](#post-147) [[3]](#post-3) [[53]](#post-53). On the other side, export‑control uncertainty has already produced ~$800 million of inventory and related charges tied to MI308, and most affected inventory is WIP—linking cash needs and liquidity headroom to license timing and multi‑quarter conversion cycles [[65]](#post-65) [[47]](#post-47).

Investors broadly frame this theme as a trade‑off: ZT divestiture and diversified CPU‑driven cash generation increase optionality to fund MI350/MI400 ramps and return capital, while aggressive repurchases can heighten liquidity sensitivity if MI308 licenses lag or additional charges emerge. The absence of disclosed binding capacity commitments from Sanmina, and the closing timing of the ZT transaction (near end‑2025), add timing risk to how quickly proceeds can be deployed to either de‑risk supply or amplify capital returns [[141]](#post-141) [[3]](#post-3).

### Analysis
The dominant view balances opportunity and caution: divesting ZT manufacturing and strong FCF expand funding capacity for MI ramps and returns, but aggressive buybacks can tighten cushions precisely as export‑license timing and WIP conversion inject volatility. Minority voices argue for accelerated repurchases to drive EPS leverage. Key uncertainties are the closing timing and use of ZT proceeds, the lack of disclosed binding capacity commitments from Sanmina, and the trajectory of export‑license approvals—factors that will determine how much AMD should prioritize balance‑sheet resilience versus stepped‑up capital returns [[3]](#post-3) [[141]](#post-141) [[78]](#post-78) [[53]](#post-53).

## Sovereign AI Partnerships: Demand Smoothing vs Governance Risk

Sovereign programs surfaced as a potentially additive, multi‑year demand vector that could smooth AMD’s AI revenue as MI350 ramps and MI400/Helios arrive in 2026, but they also introduce meaningful governance, export‑control and disclosure risks. Management cited a multibillion Humane collaboration and more than 40 active engagements, while noting sovereign deployments require navigating regulatory decisions; AMD expects sovereign demand to build alongside hyperscalers and AI‑natives, with timing potentially later than initial MI355 ramps [[34]](#post-34) [[15]](#post-15) [[51]](#post-51). Public visibility remains limited: AMD has not named specific sovereign customers beyond Humane or disclosed per‑deal values, and no formal export rulings specific to integrated Helios systems have been published [[116]](#post-116) [[89]](#post-89) [[121]](#post-121).

Investor debate centers on whether structured sovereign arrangements (offtake, prepayment, localized assembly, export‑control workstreams) can de‑risk wafer starts and WIP conversion into MI400/Helios, versus the risk that dual‑use deployments heighten re‑export, human‑rights, and reputational exposures. AMD’s existing Supplier Code and Human Rights Policy provide a governance baseline, yet third‑party audit disclosures specific to sovereign AI remain absent, and integrated racks could trigger additional licensing scrutiny—keeping execution and compliance as twin gates to monetizing this channel [[99]](#post-99) [[127]](#post-127) [[98]](#post-98) [[103]](#post-103).

— Institutional ESG Compliance Auditor; Support: 2 [[98]](#post-98)

### Analysis
The dominant view is bifurcated: sovereign partnerships could structurally de‑risk and accelerate deployments via offtake/prepayment and modular Helios approaches, yet they heighten governance and re‑export risk without standardized audits or licensing clarity. Disagreement stems from the absence of public, third‑party audit results and undisclosed sovereign contract mechanics, leaving key uncertainties around: (1) licensing pathways for integrated racks; (2) the adoption of sovereign financing/offtake structures; (3) timing and scale of named sovereign customers; and (4) whether AMD will publish deal‑specific human‑rights/export‑control audits that investors can underwrite.

## ESG Externalities and Digital Equity: Helios PUE, Water, and Access

Investors face two intertwined questions as AMD scales Helios and MI400: what are the real environmental externalities at rack and datacenter scale, and who gets access to the compute? On the environmental side, AMD has public efficiency gains and liquid-cooling partnerships, but has not published Helios‑specific PUE, water-use, or lifecycle assessments; the absence of binding environmental SLAs complicates underwriting the ESG profile at gigawatt scale. On the access side, constrained supply and premium pricing risk concentrating deployments with hyperscalers and sovereigns, but AMD’s Developer Cloud and university programs could be leveraged to broaden inclusion if backed by dedicated capacity and transparency.

The debate centers on disclosure sufficiency versus potential: some argue AMD can credibly reduce energy per training token and attach verifiable environmental SLAs to sovereign/hyperscaler contracts; others warn that without published PUE/water/LCA metrics and subsidized access programs, environmental and equity risks remain under‑documented. Public filings confirm AMD has not released Helios PUE or water metrics or binding environmental SLAs to date, heightening the importance of standardized disclosures for investors’ risk‑adjusted models [[83]](#post-83) [[146]](#post-146) [[133]](#post-133).

## Client & Gaming Flywheel and Prosumer AI-Desktop

Client and Gaming is a second growth engine alongside Data Center, with Q2 Client & Gaming revenue of $3.6B (+69% YoY) and Gaming at $1.1B (+73% YoY), supported by record desktop Ryzen, strong Radeon 9000 demand that “outpaced supply,” and new prosumer AI‑desktop vectors via Radeon AI Pro R9700 [[56]](#post-56) [[84]](#post-84). This flywheel matters for near‑term mix, ASPs and cash generation, and strategically because ROCm7 and the Developer Cloud can compress OEM validation cycles and extend AMD’s AI stack into desktop workflows, reinforcing ecosystem lock‑in across gamers, creators and small teams [[132]](#post-132) [[109]](#post-109).

Execution looks solid, but durability hinges on real sell‑through and channel health. Management flagged Q3 “flattish” Gaming vs a very strong Q2 and noted console seasonality will drive a substantial decline in Q4, while external posts caution that some Q2 strength could include OEM/retailer pull‑forwards and that AMD has not disclosed granular sell‑through/ASP metrics for new AI‑desktop SKUs [[28]](#post-28) [[75]](#post-75) [[119]](#post-119).

## IP and Legal Exposure in Rapid Rack-Scale Integration

AMD’s shift to full systems—MI350/MI400 silicon paired with ROCm software, Polarra SmartNICs, and Helios rack-scale platforms—creates new legal vectors beyond traditional chip-level risks. The dominant perspective flags heightened exposure to IP litigation and SEP/FRAND injunctions as AMD integrates acquired rack/NIC technologies under aggressive timelines and engages in high‑visibility sovereign deployments. Simultaneously, bundled rack shipments raise re‑export and “deemed export” complexities that can add legal friction to sales cycles and delivery schedules [[71]](#post-71) [[128]](#post-128) [[103]](#post-103).

Disclosure gaps compound this risk posture. AMD has not publicly detailed cross‑licensing, indemnities, or FRAND-style frameworks to preempt injunction threats tied to Helios/SmartNIC integrations, nor has it published legal frameworks designed to reduce deployment halts—leaving investors without clear policy mitigants even as rack‑scale ambitions accelerate [[110]](#post-110) [[140]](#post-140). A counterpoint: as of Q2 2025, no AMD IP or FRAND disputes tied to Helios, ZT Systems, Polarra SmartNICs, or ROCm were publicly disclosed, and AMD’s open‑stack posture could shift disputes toward licensing remedies rather than immediate injunctions [[92]](#post-92) [[100]](#post-100).

### Analysis
The core divergence is between risk elevation from rapid, integrated rack-scale deployments without disclosed cross‑licenses/indemnities and the counter‑argument that open stacks and current absence of disclosed litigation temper immediate injunction risk. Sources of disagreement include: (1) whether integration timelines outpace legal clearances; (2) the likelihood that sovereign, high‑visibility deals attract SEP/FRAND actions; and (3) the degree to which open‑stack/modular pathways mitigate injunction exposure. Key uncertainties are the publication of cross‑licenses/indemnities or FRAND frameworks, and any regulator guidance on Helios exports—without which deployment timing and legal cost assumptions remain vulnerable [[71]](#post-71) [[128]](#post-128) [[110]](#post-110) [[140]](#post-140) [[103]](#post-103) [[92]](#post-92).

## Earnings Quality, Guidance Upside, and Disclosure Gaps

AMD’s Q3 guide implies a meaningful step-up to approximately $8.7 billion (+13% sequential), with management framing MI350 as the primary driver and explicitly excluding MI308 revenue while licenses remain under review. Ex-charge gross margin resilience (~54%) alongside record EPYC and Ryzen sales supports the quality of the base, but earnings visibility is constrained by what AMD did not disclose: no per‑product MI350 contribution within the guide, limited clarity on the trajectory and reversibility of the $800 million MI308 inventory and related charges, and unresolved license timing that affects when WIP converts to revenue and margin mix tightens or improves [[3]](#post-3) [[56]](#post-56) [[65]](#post-65) [[81]](#post-81) [[148]](#post-148) [[149]](#post-149).

Beyond GPUs, disclosure gaps span channel and sell‑through diagnostics, ROCm7 Developer Cloud adoption/conversion, and MI yield and allocation details—all of which bear on forecasting the sustainability of the guide and potential upside. Posts caution that part of Q2 strength may reflect pull‑forwards, and AMD did not provide granular finished‑goods or channel inventory trends or ROCm Developer Cloud metrics; the company also has not published MI350/MI400 yield data or confirmed capacity increases at foundry/OSAT partners, which complicates revenue‑timing and margin modeling [[75]](#post-75) [[90]](#post-90) [[113]](#post-113) [[112]](#post-112) [[120]](#post-120).

### Analysis
The dominant view stresses that guidance upside hinges on MI350 while earnings quality is clouded by disclosure gaps: no MI350 line item, uncertain MI308 license timing and WIP conversion, potential channel pull‑forwards, and buybacks that heighten liquidity sensitivity. The counter‑view argues the CPU base and ex‑charge margins underpin EPS resilience and that proactive provisioning lowers enforcement‑shock risk. The crux of disagreement is how much undisclosed information (MI350 split, channel health, yields/capacity, audit outcomes) should be discounted in models. Key uncertainties are the quantified MI350 contribution to Q3, timing/conditions of MI308 license approvals, any incremental inventory charges or reversals, and concrete operational metrics (sell‑through, ROCm7 cloud conversions, yield/allocations) that would validate or falsify the embedded assumptions.

## Emerging Clusters & Factions

Eight distinct clusters emerged, splitting broadly between growth‑oriented system builders and risk‑first governance/operations factions. Debates centered on export‑control timing, WIP conversion and supply throughput, the credibility of a systems‑level moat (MI350/ROCm7/Helios), capital‑return intensity versus liquidity prudence, sovereign acceleration versus governance safeguards, and IP/FRAND exposure as rack‑scale integration accelerates.

### **Cluster 1: Compliance‑and‑Licensing Risk Realists**

- Export‑license volatility is the primary near‑term earnings driver; MI308 is excluded from Q3 guidance, most affected inventory is WIP, and 8–9 month cycles mean revenue restarts will be gradual even if licenses arrive [[56]](#post-56) [[47]](#post-47) [[94]](#post-94).  
- Heightened risk of additional write‑downs and retroactive liabilities (including re‑export/“deemed export” for integrated systems); aggressive buybacks shrink buffers while MI308 revenue is timing‑dependent [[66]](#post-66) [[74]](#post-74) [[103]](#post-103) [[78]](#post-78) [[149]](#post-149).

### **Analysis**

#### **Convergences**
- Broad agreement that MI350 is the primary Q3 growth driver while MI308 is excluded pending licenses; long manufacturing cycles (8–9 months) and backend/test constraints are real gates [[56]](#post-56) [[32]](#post-32) [[94]](#post-94).  
- Shared recognition of disclosure gaps: MI350 per‑product revenue, ROCm Developer Cloud usage/conversion, MI yield/allocations, and Helios PUE/water/LCA data are not public [[81]](#post-81) [[148]](#post-148) [[113]](#post-113) [[120]](#post-120) [[83]](#post-83) [[146]](#post-146).  
- Capital priorities: invest first to capture AI ramps, then return cash—enabled by strong FCF and expected ZT proceeds [[53]](#post-53) [[147]](#post-147) [[97]](#post-97).

#### **Fault‑Lines**
- Growth vs. risk: systems‑moat bulls see faster MI350 adoption and CPU attach vs. compliance realists prioritizing licensing uncertainty, WIP write‑downs, and re‑export friction [[26]](#post-26) [[67]](#post-67) [[66]](#post-66) [[103]](#post-103).

## Recommendations

Widely Supported
* Exclude MI308 revenue from near‑term models and scenario‑plan gradual restarts — AMD explicitly removed MI308 from Q3 guidance while licenses are under review; most affected inventory is WIP and wafer‑to‑finished‑goods cycles are ~8–9 months, so even with approvals shipments will take time to convert and recognize [[56]](#post-56) [[47]](#post-47) [[94]](#post-94) [[3]](#post-3) [[60]](#post-60).
* Add an explicit risk factor for additional export‑related inventory charges — the $800M inventory and related charges tied to MI308, WIP-heavy exposure, and evolving export‑control scope (including “deemed export”/re‑export for integrated systems) argue for a non‑trivial probability of further write‑downs until licenses are granted and WIP is converted [[65]](#post-65) [[149]](#post-149) [[86]](#post-86) [[66]](#post-66) [[74]](#post-74) [[103]](#post-103).
* Treat MI ramps as capacity‑gated — without disclosed increases in foundry/OSAT allocations or yield metrics, model shipments with conservative backend/test and substrate throughput assumptions and build sensitivity cases around HBM3E/package yield variability [[112]](#post-112) [[120]](#post-120) [[72]](#post-72) [[101]](#post-101).
* Interpret Q3 step‑up as MI350‑led but maintain margin discipline — management points to MI350 as the primary driver and guides non‑GAAP GM ~54% while noting MI margins are below corporate average; use CPU strength (record EPYC/Ryzen) as the stabilizer in mix assumptions and avoid embedding unverified MI350 splits [[3]](#post-3) [[17]](#post-17) [[65]](#post-65) [[107]](#post-107) [[81]](#post-81) [[148]](#post-148).
* Balance capital‑return expectations with export/licensing liquidity risk — track buyback cadence versus cash generation and MI308 license timing; AMD generated $1.18B FCF in Q2, has $9.5B remaining authorization, and prioritizes AI investment before repurchases; aggressive buybacks heighten sensitivity if license reviews prolong [[147]](#post-147) [[3]](#post-3) [[53]](#post-53) [[78]](#post-78).
* Anchor Client/Gaming with stated seasonality — model Gaming as “flattish” in Q3 off a very strong Q2 and incorporate a “strong double‑digit” console decline in Q4; avoid extrapolating Q2 spikes without disclosed sell‑through/ASP data and monitor channel health where available [[28]](#post-28) [[56]](#post-56) [[84]](#post-84) [[119]](#post-119) [[75]](#post-75) [[90]](#post-90).
* Treat the Developer Cloud as an adoption catalyst, not a near‑term P&L driver — management indicated it will not meaningfully add to 2H revenue; avoid modeling material contribution until AMD publishes usage or conversion metrics [[22]](#post-22) [[113]](#post-113).
* Apply a governance/compliance discount to sovereign revenue scenarios — sovereign deals are positioned as additive but require regulatory coordination; until third‑party human‑rights/export‑control audits and clear Helios licensing pathways are disclosed, assign higher execution and compliance risk premia [[15]](#post-15) [[69]](#post-69) [[98]](#post-98) [[103]](#post-103) [[121]](#post-121).
* Incorporate non‑zero legal/SEP‑FRAND risk in rack‑scale deployment timelines — no active disputes are disclosed, but AMD has not published cross‑licenses/indemnities for Helios/SmartNIC integrations; reflect potential injunction/licensing friction in timing and legal‑cost assumptions [[92]](#post-92) [[110]](#post-110) [[140]](#post-140) [[71]](#post-71) [[128]](#post-128).
* Treat Helios/Sanmina manufacturing benefits as timing‑contingent — the ZT manufacturing sale is expected to close near end‑2025 and no binding capacity commitments have been published; avoid assuming incremental assembly/test throughput until terms are disclosed; model MI400/Helios contribution beginning 2026 per management commentary [[3]](#post-3) [[141]](#post-141) [[144]](#post-144) [[51]](#post-51).

Experimental / Watch-list
* MI350 upside sensitivity — set a scenario range using the community estimate that MI350 could add ~$1.0–1.5B incremental in Q3; track for any per‑product revenue disclosure (currently undisclosed) and validate against actual shipments; treat < $500M as a downside falsifier [[73]](#post-73) [[81]](#post-81) [[148]](#post-148).
* EPYC attach acceleration — monitor cloud/enterprise signals (instance launches, enterprise wins) to validate that AI token workloads are lifting CPU demand alongside MI350; use this as a cushion in downside GPU scenarios [[23]](#post-23) [[44]](#post-44) [[67]](#post-67).
* Sovereign demand de‑risking — watch for sovereign offtake/prepayment, modular Helios/onshore integration, and export‑control enclave constructs that could fund wafer starts and accelerate WIP conversion; use disclosed MOUs or terms as triggers to pull forward MI350→MI400 revenue timing [[99]](#post-99) [[127]](#post-127) [[116]](#post-116) [[89]](#post-89).
* Capacity confirmation triggers — look for: (1) partner announcements of additional foundry/OSAT/test allocations; (2) evidence of wafer‑starts up three consecutive months; (3) Sanmina binding commitments for Helios/MI400 assembly/test; use these as catalysts to tighten ramp assumptions [[112]](#post-112) [[72]](#post-72) [[141]](#post-141) [[144]](#post-144).
* Environmental SLAs as a potential moat — if AMD or counterparties publish Helios PUE, water‑use, lifecycle LCA, or contract‑level environmental SLAs, incorporate improved TCO/ESG into sovereign/hyperscaler win‑rate assumptions; absence keeps an ESG risk discount in place [[105]](#post-105) [[83]](#post-83) [[146]](#post-146) [[133]](#post-133).
* Channel pull‑forward falsifiers — validate Q2 momentum by tracking sequential retail sell‑through and finished‑goods inventory; rising sell‑through and stable inventories would weaken the pull‑forward risk case [[75]](#post-75) [[84]](#post-84) [[90]](#post-90).
* Licensing milestones — treat confirmed DOC approvals and shipment restarts within ~90 days as a catalyst that reduces write‑down risk; absent approvals, keep a higher probability of additional export‑related charges [[66]](#post-66) [[86]](#post-86) [[121]](#post-121).
* IP risk mitigants — watch for published cross‑license/indemnity frameworks or, conversely, any injunction/FRAND filings; use disclosures to adjust legal contingency reserves in models [[110]](#post-110) [[140]](#post-140) [[100]](#post-100) [[71]](#post-71) [[128]](#post-128) [[92]](#post-92).
* Inclusive access signals — track for a dedicated “Global Access Allocation” or similar committed capacity in the Developer Cloud aimed at underserved regions; presence could expand long‑term TAM and reduce concentration risk, while absence sustains equity and reputational risk premia [[136]](#post-136) [[138]](#post-138) [[122]](#post-122).
* Yield transparency — if AMD publishes wafer/package yield stability for MI350/MI400, reduce manufacturing risk discounts and pull forward ramp curves; lacking data, keep conservative conversion assumptions [[101]](#post-101) [[120]](#post-120).

## Expert Network Questions

### **Profile 1 – Senior Export‑Control Counsel (AI accelerators and integrated systems licensing)**
- What specific licensing pathways and conditions most commonly govern shipments of data center AI GPUs to China today, and what documentation sets (end‑user/end‑use attestations, technical parameters, telemetry controls) measurably compress review cycles below 90 days?
- Given most MI308 exposure is work‑in‑process, how would you sequence compliance, finishing, and shipment once licenses arrive; what are realistic “license-to-ship” and “WIP-to-FG” timelines investors should underwrite?
- Under what circumstances do “deemed export” or “re‑export” rules get triggered by integrated rack shipments (GPUs + SmartNICs + firmware/software), and which bundling choices (e.g., onshore vs offshore integration) materially change license requirements?
- What regulatory scope changes (e.g., parameter thresholds, software/firmware controls) would you view as red flags for additional inventory write‑downs or retroactive liabilities on already‑fabricated WIP?
- If licenses are approved with usage or entity restrictions, what typical covenants (geofencing, monitoring, field‑programmable fusing) are imposed, and how do those covenants affect sales cycles and service obligations?
- From an accounting and compliance perspective, when is reversal of prior export‑related inventory reserves defensible, and what evidence (license terms, shipment proof, customer acceptance) is typically required?
- For sovereign contracts involving multi‑party supply chains, what pre‑clearance mechanisms (framework licenses, end‑use audits, firmware escrow) most effectively de‑risk approvals for rack‑level systems?

### **Profile 2 – Advanced Packaging/Test Operations Director (HBM3E, CoWoS, backend/test capacity planning)**
- With an 8–9 month wafer‑to‑finished‑goods cycle, which process steps (wafer starts, 2.5D packaging, HBM attach, final test) are the dominant gating items for an MI350 ramp, and which of those can be accelerated with cash prepayments or priority allocations?
- What package‑yield and HBM‑attach yield thresholds typically mark the transition from “learning curve” to stable high‑volume output on a new GPU, and how should investors translate early yield variance into shipment and gross‑margin sensitivity?
- If MI350 contributes $1.0–1.5B incremental revenue sequentially, what rough order‑of‑magnitude test/pack slots and high‑end substrate availability would that imply per month, and what early‑warning indicators reveal whether those resources are actually in place?
- How would you triage constrained backend/test lines between legacy WIP (e.g., MI308) and newer ramps (MI350→MI400) to minimize stranded wafers and markdown risk; what practical levers (down‑binning, die harvesting, re‑targeting) are viable at this stage?
- What objective signals should investors watch to validate real capacity ramp (e.g., three consecutive months of wafer‑start increases, OSAT/tool move‑ins, substrate lead‑time compression), and which signals tend to be false positives?
- How might outsourcing rack manufacturing to a contract manufacturer shift the bottleneck map for Helios/MI400 (assembly vs. test vs. substrate), and what binding capacity terms (racks/month, test slots/month) would you consider necessary to de‑risk 2026 deliveries?
- If export licenses for legacy parts arrive mid‑quarter, what is a realistic cadence for converting existing WIP to shippable units without disrupting MI350 throughput, and how would you sequence labor, tooling, and test priorities to avoid margin dilution?

### **Profile 3 – Sovereign AI Deal Architect & ESG Auditor (offtake/prepayment, modular Helios, audit safeguards)**
- For large sovereign programs, which contractual mechanisms (offtake/prepayment, sovereign‑backed financing, milestone gating to license approvals) most effectively de‑risk wafer starts and accelerate WIP conversion into revenue?
- How would you structure a modular Helios deployment (sealed compute modules offshore + onshore integration) to meet data‑residency goals while minimizing re‑export/deemed‑export exposure, and what documentation package should be baked into the contract?
- What constitutes a credible third‑party audit regime for human‑rights and export‑control due diligence in sovereign AI (scope, cadence, remediation timelines), and what minimum public disclosures should investors require before underwriting multi‑year revenue?
- Which environmental SLAs (rack‑/site‑level PUE targets, water‑reuse thresholds, end‑of‑life recycling) are practical to attach to AI rack contracts, how should verification be executed, and what remedies/penalties ensure compliance without stalling deployments?
- What procurement and policy bottlenecks most often delay sovereign awards or integration (data‑sovereignty rules, security certifications, cross‑border data flows), and how do those timelines align with MI355 availability now and MI400/Helios in 2026?
- To broaden access while supply is constrained, what scale and design of a dedicated Developer Cloud allocation for underserved regions (e.g., committed GPU‑hours/month with eligibility criteria) would be meaningful without impairing commercial customer ramps?
- For integrated rack shipments into sensitive jurisdictions, which end‑use monitoring, telemetry, and firmware‑escrow constructs materially improve license approval odds while preserving customer TCO and operational autonomy?

## Top Reinforced Points & Network Propagation

### MI308 License Delays Strand WIP

> “[Risk] Prolonged U.S. license review risks additional MI-308 write-downs because affected inventory is largely WIP that needs months of fab/test/packaging and constrained foundry/test capacity could reallocate to MI350/MI400, stranding wafers and forcing markdowns.

## Materiality & Impact Assessment

### **Theme 1 — Export Controls and Licensing Volatility: Revenue Timing, Write-Down Risk, and Compliance Exposure**

#### **Scale**
- Material financial impact already realized: ~$800M inventory and related charges tied to MI308 restrictions; Data Center posted a $155M operating loss primarily due to these charges [[65]](#post-65) [[2]](#post-2) [[149]](#post-149).
- Revenue visibility impact: MI308 is excluded from Q3 guidance; most affected inventory is WIP rather than finished goods, delaying conversion even if licenses arrive [[56]](#post-56) [[47]](#post-47).
- Compliance exposure extends beyond chips to integrated racks (Helios), where re‑export/“deemed export” rules can add license requirements, denial risk and friction [[103]](#post-103).

#### **Timing**
- Immediate: Q2 charges recognized; Q3 guide excludes MI308 as licenses remain under review [[65]](#post-65) [[56]](#post-56).
- Near‑term (2H25): Any restart is gradual due to 8–9 month wafer‑to‑finished‑goods cycles and WIP status [[94]](#post-94) [[47]](#post-47).
- Mid‑term (2026): Rack‑level export complexity may intersect with Helios launches and sovereign deployments [[45]](#post-45) [[103]](#post-103).

#### **Dependencies**
- U.S. Department of Commerce license approvals and any conditions imposed
  - If approvals and shipments occur within ~90 days, downside lessens [[66]](#post-66).
- Ability to convert MI308 WIP to finished goods without displacing MI350/MI400 ramps [[47]](#post-47) [[72]](#post-72).
- Stability of export‑control scope across MI308/MI350/MI400 and integrated systems [[74]](#post-74) [[103]](#post-103).
- End‑customer demand and supply‑chain readiness once licenses are granted [[45]](#post-45) [[56]](#post-56).

#### **Net Impact**
- Ambiguous, skewing negative near term. Charges and review delays depress visibility; upside from approvals is capped by WIP conversion lags and potential re‑export complexities. Conservative provisioning and regulator engagement help but do not remove timing risk [[131]](#post-131) [[86]](#post-86) [[56]](#post-56).


### **Theme 2 — Supply Chain Throughput, Yield, and WIP Conversion Constraints**

#### **Scale**
- Throughput is a primary gating factor for revenue: AMD cites 8–9 months end‑to‑end cycle time; MI350 entered volume production in June; adoption is tracking faster than expected [[94]](#post-94) [[20]](#post-20) [[26]](#post-26).
- Backend/test and substrate constraints and unknown yields on complex HBM3E packages can bottleneck shipments and pressure unit costs [[72]](#post-72) [[101]](#post-101).
- No public disclosure of incremental foundry/OSAT allocations or yield metrics limits forecasting precision [[112]](#post-112) [[120]](#post-120).

#### **Timing**
- Immediate–near term (2H25): MI350 ramp underway; shipment velocity capacity‑bound [[20]](#post-20) [[94]](#post-94).
- Mid‑term (2026): MI400/Helios scale will stress assembly/test and substrate pipelines [[45]](#post-45) [[51]](#post-51).

#### **Dependencies**
- Sustained access to advanced packaging/test slots and high‑end substrates [[72]](#post-72).
- Yield stabilization for wafer and package (HBM3E attach, CoWoS‑class steps) [[101]](#post-101).
- Confirmed partner allocations or wafer‑start trends (e.g., consecutive months up) [[112]](#post-112) [[72]](#post-72).
- Prioritization choices between legacy WIP (MI308) and new ramps (MI350→MI400) [[66]](#post-66).

#### **Net Impact**
- Ambiguous. If allocations and yields firm, revenue can scale; absent disclosure/allocations, bottlenecks can delay shipments and elevate costs. WIP overhang from MI308 increases risk of stranded capacity if priority shifts to MI350/MI400 [[66]](#post-66) [[72]](#post-72).


### **Theme 3 — System-Level AI Stack: MI350/MI400, ROCm7, Helios, and EPYC Attach**

#### **Scale**
- Strategically significant: Data Center grew 14% YoY on EPYC momentum; MI355 positioned to match/exceed top alternatives on key workloads with TCO advantages; Oracle building a 27,000+ node MI355–EPYC–Polarra cluster [[23]](#post-23) [[34]](#post-34).
- ROCm7 and the Developer Cloud aim to compress validation cycles; EPYC demand rises as each AI token increases CPU tasks, reinforcing attach [[23]](#post-23) [[34]](#post-34).
- Helios (72 GPUs per rack) targets a 10x generational performance step for frontier models; expected significant revenue in 2026 [[45]](#post-45) [[51]](#post-51).

#### **Timing**
- Near term (2H25): MI350 production began in June; ramping across multiple customers [[20]](#post-20) [[34]](#post-34).
- Mid‑term (2026): MI400/Helios launch with large rack‑scale deployments under co‑engineering with customers [[45]](#post-45) [[32]](#post-32) [[51]](#post-51).

#### **Dependencies**
- MI350 supply lead times and volume availability [[20]](#post-20) [[32]](#post-32).
- Software maturity and ecosystem support (ROCm7, nightly builds, containers) [[34]](#post-34).
- Customer validation/compatibility with existing data centers; reuse of EPYC/NIC infrastructure [[34]](#post-34).
- Absence of export/IP frictions that delay system deployments [[103]](#post-103) [[71]](#post-71).

#### **Net Impact**
- Likely positive. Strong qualitative adoption signals and CPU–GPU pull‑through support the systems‑moat thesis, with execution gated by supply throughput and compliance/legal frictions [[26]](#post-26) [[34]](#post-34) [[72]](#post-72) [[103]](#post-103).


### **Theme 4 — Capital Allocation, Buybacks, and Liquidity Sensitivity**

#### **Scale**
- Capital flexibility is high: record Q2 FCF ~$1.18B; $478M repurchased; $9.5B authorization remaining; expected ~$3B proceeds from ZT manufacturing sale near end‑2025; investment first, buybacks second [[147]](#post-147) [[3]](#post-3) [[53]](#post-53) [[97]](#post-97).
- Risk: buybacks amplify liquidity sensitivity while MI308 revenues depend on license outcomes [[78]](#post-78).

#### **Timing**
- Immediate–near term (2H25): ongoing repurchases; FCF supported by CPU strength [[3]](#post-3) [[107]](#post-107).
- Mid‑term (late‑2025 to 2026): ZT deal closing near end‑2025; potential redeployment toward MI400/ROCm or additional buybacks [[3]](#post-3) [[97]](#post-97).

#### **Dependencies**
- Sustained FCF from EPYC/Ryzen and MI350 ramp [[23]](#post-23) [[56]](#post-56).
- Closing of the Sanmina transaction and proceeds availability [[3]](#post-3) [[97]](#post-97).
- Export‑license timing to avoid further inventory charges and cash drains [[56]](#post-56) [[65]](#post-65) [[78]](#post-78).

#### **Net Impact**
- Ambiguous. Strong cash generation and pending proceeds enable both investment and returns, but aggressive buybacks heighten downside if export approvals lag or additional charges emerge [[78]](#post-78) [[53]](#post-53).


### **Theme 5 — Sovereign AI Partnerships: Demand Smoothing vs Governance Risk**

#### **Scale**
- Potentially large, multi‑year demand vector: >40 active engagements; multibillion Humane collaboration; positioned as additive alongside hyperscalers and AI‑natives [[34]](#post-34) [[15]](#post-15) [[70]](#post-70).
- Structures (offtake/prepayment, modular deployments) could de‑risk wafer‑starts and accelerate WIP conversion, but terms undisclosed [[99]](#post-99) [[127]](#post-127).

#### **Timing**
- Near term: initial Humane deployments underway; regulatory decisions in flight [[34]](#post-34) [[15]](#post-15).
- Mid‑term (2026): sovereign demand expected to build with MI400/Helios; sovereign may start later than early MI355 ramps [[51]](#post-51).

#### **Dependencies**
- Regulatory/export approvals and clear guidance for integrated systems [[15]](#post-15) [[103]](#post-103).
- Adoption of offtake/prepayment or localized assembly approaches to fund wafer‑starts and speed conversion [[99]](#post-99) [[127]](#post-127).
- Publication of governance safeguards (e.g., third‑party human‑rights/export‑control audits) [[69]](#post-69) [[98]](#post-98).

#### **Net Impact**
- Ambiguous. Demand could smooth and scale ramps, but governance and export complexity introduce meaningful execution and reputational risks without standardized audits and license clarity [[69]](#post-69) [[103]](#post-103).


### **Theme 6 — ESG Externalities and Digital Equity: Helios PUE, Water, and Access**

#### **Scale**
- System‑level externalities likely significant at rack/datacenter scale; AMD reports 13.5× efficiency improvement vs 2020 but has not published Helios‑specific PUE, water‑use, or lifecycle assessments; no binding environmental SLAs disclosed [[83]](#post-83) [[146]](#post-146) [[105]](#post-105) [[133]](#post-133).
- Access concentration risk: scarce supply and premium pricing could prioritize hyperscalers/sovereigns; Developer Cloud/university programs exist but no dedicated “Global Access Allocation” is disclosed [[79]](#post-79) [[122]](#post-122) [[138]](#post-138).

#### **Timing**
- Immediate: disclosure gaps persist as of Q2 2025; Developer Cloud launched in June 2025 [[83]](#post-83) [[113]](#post-113) [[122]](#post-122).
- Mid‑term (2026): Helios launch increases relevance of environmental SLAs and access policies [[45]](#post-45) [[51]](#post-51).

#### **Dependencies**
- Publication of Helios PUE/water/LCA metrics and contractual environmental SLAs [[146]](#post-146) [[133]](#post-133).
- Design and commitment of a dedicated, subsidized access allocation for underserved regions [[138]](#post-138) [[108]](#post-108).
- Customer willingness to accept environmental targets and verification in contracts [[133]](#post-133).

#### **Net Impact**
- Ambiguous. Strong efficiency narrative and liquid cooling partners support TCO/ESG claims, but lack of Helios‑specific metrics and access commitments sustains ESG and reputational risk premia [[105]](#post-105) [[146]](#post-146) [[79]](#post-79).


### **Theme 7 — Client & Gaming Flywheel and Prosumer AI-Desktop**

#### **Scale**
- Financially meaningful counter‑balance to Data Center: Client & Gaming revenue $3.6B (+69% YoY); Gaming $1.1B (+73% YoY) with Radeon 9000 demand outpacing supply; new multi‑year Xbox collaboration and deeper Sony co‑engineering [[56]](#post-56) [[84]](#post-84) [[63]](#post-63).
- Prosumer AI‑desktop vector (Radeon AI Pro R9700) adds incremental attach potential; detailed sell‑through/ASP metrics not disclosed [[109]](#post-109) [[119]](#post-119).

#### **Timing**
- Immediate: Q2 momentum; Q3 “flattish” Gaming vs very strong Q2; Q4 console “down strong double digits” seasonally [[28]](#post-28).
- Ongoing: commercial client ramps at Dell/HP/Lenovo; Ryzen AI adoption and OEM co‑engineering continue [[56]](#post-56).

#### **Dependencies**
- Sustained retail sell‑through vs potential pull‑forwards; channel inventory health [[84]](#post-84) [[75]](#post-75) [[90]](#post-90).
- OEM validation speed and portfolio breadth (Ryzen AI, desktop mix, co‑engineered SKUs) [[56]](#post-56) [[132]](#post-132).
- Supply sufficiency for Radeon 9000 amid tightness [[84]](#post-84).

#### **Net Impact**
- Positive near term with caveats. Strong ASPs and ecosystem momentum support mix and cash generation; seasonality and limited disclosure on AI‑desktop metrics temper durability confidence [[28]](#post-28) [[119]](#post-119) [[75]](#post-75).


### **Theme 8 — IP and Legal Exposure in Rapid Rack-Scale Integration**

#### **Scale**
- Elevated risk of SEP/FRAND claims and injunction exposure as Helios/Polarra integrations roll out; no public cross‑licenses/indemnities disclosed; integrated racks may also trigger re‑export complexities [[71]](#post-71) [[128]](#post-128) [[110]](#post-110) [[103]](#post-103).
- As of Q2 2025, no related IP litigation publicly disclosed, and open‑stack posture could reduce injunction‑style blockers [[92]](#post-92) [[100]](#post-100).

#### **Timing**
- Near–mid term: increases as MI350 scales and MI400/Helios approach 2026 deployments; potential to intersect sovereign/high‑visibility deals [[51]](#post-51) [[71]](#post-71).

#### **Dependencies**
- Publication of cross‑license/indemnity terms or FRAND frameworks to de‑risk injunctions [[110]](#post-110) [[140]](#post-140).
- Clear export guidance for integrated systems to reduce compliance friction [[103]](#post-103).
- Customer integration timelines and visibility of high‑profile deployments [[51]](#post-51).

#### **Net Impact**
- Ambiguous to negative risk. Absence of disclosed legal frameworks keeps the risk of deployment‑delaying disputes non‑trivial, though lack of active cases and open‑stack options partially mitigate near‑term probability [[92]](#post-92) [[100]](#post-100).


### **Theme 9 — Earnings Quality, Guidance Upside, and Disclosure Gaps**

#### **Scale**
- Q3 revenue guide ~$8.7B (+13% seq) with MI350 as the primary driver; non‑GAAP GM ~54% despite MI products below corporate average; $800M charges reduced EPS by ~$0.43 in Q2 [[3]](#post-3) [[56]](#post-56) [[17]](#post-17) [[65]](#post-65).
- Upside scenario: MI350 adding ~$1.0–1.5B incremental revenue in Q3 could lift FY25 EPS and the forward multiple; however, AMD has not disclosed MI350 per‑product contribution [[73]](#post-73) [[81]](#post-81) [[148]](#post-148).
- Visibility gaps: channel pull‑forward risk unverified; limited channel inventory detail; no Developer Cloud user/conversion metrics; no yield or capacity allocation disclosures [[75]](#post-75) [[90]](#post-90) [[113]](#post-113) [[112]](#post-112) [[120]](#post-120).

#### **Timing**
- Immediate (Q3–Q4): guidance upside driven by MI350; MI308 remains excluded pending licenses [[56]](#post-56).
- Mid‑term (2026): MI400/Helios contributions and sovereign ramps shape out‑year earnings trajectory [[51]](#post-51).

#### **Dependencies**
- MI350 shipment volumes and customer scale‑outs vs capacity gates [[20]](#post-20) [[72]](#post-72).
- Sustained CPU strength to support margins while GPU mix expands [[23]](#post-23) [[65]](#post-65) [[107]](#post-107).
- Export‑license timing to avoid further charges and to enable WIP conversion [[65]](#post-65) [[56]](#post-56).
- Improved transparency (per‑product MI350 revenue, sell‑through, yields/allocations, Developer Cloud metrics) [[81]](#post-81) [[113]](#post-113) [[112]](#post-112) [[120]](#post-120).

#### **Net Impact**
- Ambiguous. Clear near‑term growth drivers (MI350, CPUs) are offset by disclosure gaps and export timing risk; magnitude of upside depends on MI350 quantification and evidence that channel strength and supply conversions are durable [[73]](#post-73) [[75]](#post-75).


## Cross-Theme Interaction Summary

✅ Export Controls and Licensing Volatility: Revenue Timing, Write-Down Risk, and Compliance Exposure ↔ Supply Chain Throughput, Yield, and WIP Conversion Constraints — License delays collide with 8–9 month cycles and limited backend/test capacity, raising stranded‑WIP and markdown risk while slowing revenue conversion.

✅ Export Controls and Licensing Volatility: Revenue Timing, Write-Down Risk, and Compliance Exposure ↔ System-Level AI Stack: MI350/MI400, ROCm7, Helios, and EPYC Attach — MI308 exclusions shift growth reliance to MI350/ROCm and EPYC attach; integrated Helios may face re‑export scrutiny that can slow system deployments.

✅ Export Controls and Licensing Volatility: Revenue Timing, Write-Down Risk, and Compliance Exposure ↔ Capital Allocation, Buybacks, and Liquidity Sensitivity — Aggressive buybacks elevate liquidity sensitivity precisely as export approvals and WIP conversion remain uncertain.

✅ Export Controls and Licensing Volatility: Revenue Timing, Write-Down Risk, and Compliance Exposure ↔ Sovereign AI Partnerships: Demand Smoothing vs Governance Risk — Sovereign ramps require regulatory coordination; export and audit gaps can constrain otherwise additive demand.

✅ Export Controls and Licensing Volatility: Revenue Timing, Write-Down Risk, and Compliance Exposure ↔ IP and Legal Exposure in Rapid Rack-Scale Integration — Re‑export and “deemed export” risks increase with integrated racks, intersecting with potential SEP/FRAND disputes.

✅ Supply Chain Throughput, Yield, and WIP Conversion Constraints ↔ System-Level AI Stack: MI350/MI400, ROCm7, Helios, and EPYC Attach — Even with strong demand and software readiness, shipments remain capacity‑gated; yield and packaging/test throughput determine ramp velocity.

✅ Supply Chain Throughput, Yield, and WIP Conversion Constraints ↔ Capital Allocation, Buybacks, and Liquidity Sensitivity — Cash and pending proceeds can be used to secure allocations; absent binding commitments, execution remains allocation‑dependent.

✅ System-Level AI Stack: MI350/MI400, ROCm7, Helios, and EPYC Attach ↔ Sovereign AI Partnerships: Demand Smoothing vs Governance Risk — Helios/MI400 are central to sovereign interest; governance and export processes will shape timing and scale.

✅ System-Level AI Stack: MI350/MI400, ROCm7, Helios, and EPYC Attach ↔ IP and Legal Exposure in Rapid Rack-Scale Integration — Rack‑scale integration elevates SEP/FRAND and compliance vectors that can delay deployments if not pre‑cleared.

✅ Capital Allocation, Buybacks, and Liquidity Sensitivity ↔ Earnings Quality, Guidance Upside, and Disclosure Gaps — Return cadence and proceeds allocation influence EPS sensitivity amid undisclosed MI350 splits and export timing.

✅ Sovereign AI Partnerships: Demand Smoothing vs Governance Risk ↔ ESG Externalities and Digital Equity: Helios PUE, Water, and Access — State‑scale deployments heighten expectations for environmental SLAs and access commitments; absent disclosures, risk premia persist.

✅ Client & Gaming Flywheel and Prosumer AI-Desktop ↔ Earnings Quality, Guidance Upside, and Disclosure Gaps — Strong Q2 performance supports near‑term mix and cash, but seasonality and limited sell‑through/ASP metrics constrain durability confidence.

## Appendix: Agent Transcripts

### Round 0

<a id="post-1"></a>
[1] **Conference Operator** Conference Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the AMD Second Quarter twenty twenty five Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. And it is now my pleasure to introduce to you Matthew Ramsey, VP of Investor Relations and Financial Strategy. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.

<a id="post-2"></a>
[2] **Jean Hu, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, AMD** The inventory and the related charges reduced earnings per share by approximately $0.43 Now turning to our reportable segment, starting with the data center. Data center segment revenue was $3,200,000,000 up 14% year over year, driven by strong added CPU revenue and the share gains across both cloud and enterprise customers. On a sequential basis, data center revenue decreased 12% due to the impact of the XBOP controls on MI-three zero eight. The data center segment operating loss was $155,000,000 compared to operating income of $743,000,000 a year ago or 26% of revenue. The loss was primarily due to the inventory and related charges. Client and Gaming segment revenue was $3,600,000,000 up 69% year over year and 20% sequentially, driven by record client CPU sales and strong demand for our PC and console gaming products. In the client business, revenue was a record of $2,500,000,000 up 67% year over year, driven by record sales of our Ryzen desktop CPUs and the richer product mix. Gaming revenue rose to 1,100,000,000 up 73% year over year, reflecting strong demand for our newly launched gaming GPUs and higher semi customer revenue as inventory has now normalized and the customers prepare for the holiday season. Client and Gaming segment operating income was $767,000,000 or 21% of revenue compared to $166,000,000 or 8% a year ago, driven by richer client product mix and operating leverage on higher revenue. Embedded segment revenue was $824,000,000 down 4% year over year and flat sequentially as embedded end market demand remains mixed. Embedded segment operating income was $275,000,000 or 33% of revenue compared to $345,000,000 or 40% a year ago. The decline in operating income was primarily due to product mix. Before I review the balance sheet and the cash flow, as a reminder, we closed the acquisition of ZT Systems early in the second quarter as we had announced our intent to divest ZT manufacturing business. The financial results of the ZT manufacturing business are reported separately in our financial statement as discontinued operations and are excluded from our non GAAP financials. Subsequently, in May, we entered into agreement with the Samina Corporation to sell the ZTE manufacturing business for $3,000,000,000 in cash and stock, inclusive of contingent payment.

<a id="post-3"></a>
[3] **Jean Hu, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, AMD** The transaction is expected to close near the 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and the customary closing conditions. Turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $1,500,000,000 in cash from operating activities of continuing operations. And the free cash flow was a record of $1,200,000,000 We returned $478,000,000 to shareholders through share repurchase, resulting in $1,200,000,000 in share repurchases for the 2025. In May, our Board of Directors approved additional $6,000,000,000 authorization. Exiting the quarter, have 9,500,000,000 remaining under our share repurchase program. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and short term investment were $5,900,000,000 Our long term debt was $3,200,000,000 During the quarter, we paid down $950,000,000 of commercial paper used to finance the ZT system acquisition close. Now turning to our third quarter twenty twenty five outlook. Please note that our third quarter outlook does not include the annual revenue from AMD Instinct MI-three zero eight shipment to China, as our license applications are currently under review by U. S. Government. For the 2025, we expect revenue to be approximately 8,700,000,000.0 plus or minus $300,000,000 The midpoint of our guidance represents approximately 28% year over year revenue growth, driven by strong double digit growth in our client and the gaming and the data center segments. Sequentially, we expect revenue to grow by approximately 13%, driven by strong double digit growth in the data center segment with the ramp of our AMD Instinct MI350 Series GPU product, modest growth in our client and gaming segment with the client revenue increasing and the gaming revenue to be flattish. And our embedded segment revenue to return to growth. In addition, we expect third quarter non GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54% and we expect non GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 2,550,000,000 We expect net interest and other expenses to be again of approximately $10,000,000 We expect our non GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1,630,000,000.00 shares. In closing, we executed very well in the first half of the year, delivering record revenue and building strong momentum for growth in the second half. The strategic investment we’re making position us to capitalize on the expanding AI opportunities across all our end markets, driving sustainable long term revenue growth and earnings expansion for compelling value creation. With that, I’ll turn it back to Matt for the Q and A session.

<a id="post-4"></a>
[4] **Matthew Ramsey, VP of Investor Relations and Financial Strategy, AMD** Matthew Ramsey, VP of Investor Relations and Financial Strategy, AMD: Operator, will you please poll the audience for questions? Thank you.

<a id="post-5"></a>
[5] **Conference Operator** Conference Operator: Yes. Thank you, Matt. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. And the first question comes from the line of Thomas O’Malley with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.

<a id="post-6"></a>
[6] **Thomas O’Malley, Analyst, Barclays** Thomas O’Malley, Analyst, Barclays: Hey, thank you for taking my questions and I appreciate it. Lisa, I wanted to start on the client business. So you had previously laid out a second half outlook that was roughly flattish with the first half as you’re kind of protecting against some pull forward. So first, do you think that your Q2 results included some pull forwards and the second half should still be flattish? And longer term after the Intel commentary regarding 18A, maybe what that means as a knee jerk reaction just right away for AMD longer term in terms of share in ASPs?

<a id="post-7"></a>
[7] **Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD** Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD: Sure, Tom. Thanks for the question. So first of all, our client and gaming segment, and particularly our client business, just performed very well in the first half of the year. I think if you look at the entire first half, was up 68% year over year. I think if you look underneath that, what we’re seeing is strength in every part of our client business. So we saw very strong sales in our desktop channel area. We have a leadership product there, best gaming GPUs with our X3D GPUs. We’ve had strong Ryzen AI adoption as well in the first half of the year. We see that in sell through. And in addition, we’ve had strong enterprise sell through as we brought that forward. So to your question of how much is pulled forward, we don’t think a whole lot of that is. We actually when we look at the sell through patterns, the end user consumption is actually quite strong In terms of going into the second half of the year, as we said in Q3 guide, the primary driver of our Q3 guide is a very strong data center driven by MI350 ramping. We are expecting some growth in the client business. So I wouldn’t say it’ll be flat to the first half, but it will be we’re planning for it to be a little bit less than seasonal, just given some of the uncertainties out there. But the client business is performing extremely well for us. We believe we are gaining share in all the right places. So if you look at the numbers in the first quarter, and it will show through in the second quarter as well, a lot of the uplift in revenue is in ASPs. And that is basically, we’re selling up the stack on the strength of our portfolio. And I think we’re still quite underrepresented in the enterprise portion of the business. That is where we have increased our go to market resources and focus, and we’re seeing nice traction there, especially with the portfolios that we have from HP and Lenovo in enterprise PCs. And now we’re adding Dell as well as it’s ramping here, started in the second quarter, we’ll ramp more in the second half of the year. So I think all of those are tailwinds for our client business beyond the 2025, but really into the next number of quarters as we think about the portfolio and the opportunities for us.

<a id="post-8"></a>
[8] **Thomas O’Malley, Analyst, Barclays** Thomas O’Malley, Analyst, Barclays: Super helpful. And then secondly, was hopeful you could provide us a little more color on China. So the guide doesn’t include MI-three zero eight, but perhaps you could comment on when you get approval, if the supply chain is ready, what’s currently in inventory and maybe compare what you think the contribution will look like versus the $700,000,000 in Q2 and the $800,000,000 for the second half you spoke about in April?

<a id="post-9"></a>
[9] **Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD** Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD: Sure, Tom. So yes, let me answer some of the questions on China. I’m sure that there are some questions. Look, we’re very pleased with the progress that’s been made with the administration over the last couple of months. We’ve been working very closely with the administration. I think the focus here on ensuring that US technology gets utilized throughout the world is something that we certainly support and very much want to contribute to. China is an important market for us. Given the timing of licenses, we have a number of licenses that are under review now. We are working with the Department of Commerce to get those reviewed. We do expect that once those licenses are approved, we will start MI-three zero eight shipments. In terms of the supply chain, most of our inventory was not in finished goods. So it was work in process and it’ll take us a couple of quarters to run through that. The exact timing of revenue and contribution will depend a bit on when those are when the licenses are actually granted. But overall, I think this is a better position than we were ninety days ago. And we certainly view China as a market that we would like to service with MI-three zero eight. And we’re working closely with the administration to do that.

<a id="post-10"></a>
[10] **Conference Operator** Conference Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed with your question.

<a id="post-11"></a>
[11] **Vivek Arya, Analyst, Bank of America Securities** Vivek Arya, Analyst, Bank of America Securities: Thank you for taking my question. Lisa, if we look into 2026, right, that’s when I think the sovereign opportunity could get quite meaningful for AMD. What is the right way to size that? You know, what does this JV structure structure mean with some of the contracts that you have signed? Would you consider this incremental to the kind of growth rate that you’re seeing with your current MI business, or would this be instead of? So just if you could give us a way to size what is that incremental opportunity from sovereign customers when it comes to 26, is it dependent on MI 400, right? In which case it might be more backup data, etcetera. So, just some ways to think about sovereign for AMD next year.

<a id="post-12"></a>
[12] **Matthew Ramsey, VP of Investor Relations and Financial Strategy, AMD** Matthew Ramsey, VP of Investor Relations and Financial Strategy, AMD: Thank you, and welcome to AMD’s twenty twenty five second quarter financial results conference call. By now, you should have had the opportunity to review a copy of our earnings press release and the accompanying slides. If you have not had the chance to review these materials, they can be found on the Investor Relations page of amd.com. We will refer primarily to non GAAP financial measures during today’s call. The full non GAAP to GAAP reconciliations are available in today’s press release and slides posted on our website. Participants in today’s conference call are Doctor. Lisa Su, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer and Jean Hu, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. This is a live call and will be replayed via webcast on our website. Before we begin, I would like to note that Jean Hu, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer will present at Citi’s twenty twenty five Global TMT Conference on Wednesday, September 3. And Forrest Norad, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Data Center Solutions Business Unit will present at the Goldman Sachs Communicopia and Technology Conference on Monday, September 8. Today’s discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, speaks only as of today and as such involves risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. Please refer to the cautionary statement in our press release for more information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. With that, I will hand the call over to Lisa.

<a id="post-13"></a>
[13] **Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD** Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD: Yeah, absolutely, Vivek. Thanks for the question.

<a id="post-14"></a>
[14] **Analyst, Wells Fargo** Analyst, Wells Fargo: So

<a id="post-15"></a>
[15] **Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD** Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD: look, we’re really excited about the overall AI opportunity for us with MI three fifty five and the MI 400 series as we go through the back half of this year and into 2026. I think it’s there’s a very large opportunity with, let’s call it hyperscalers, some of the leading AI companies as well as Sovereign. I think Sovereign is additive to that for sure. From the standpoint of what to expect, there are also some regulatory things that need to be worked through on the sovereign side. But again, we were working closely with the administration as they go through the various regulatory decisions that need to be made. But from my perspective, I think the fact that countries want their own sovereign computing capability is very, very clear. I think we see that all over the world. The humane opportunity that you’re referring to that we announced with the Kingdom Of Saudi Arabia, think is a great example of where together with their ambitions, our technology, I think you heard from Tarek that was he was at our event saying that that would start with MI-three 55, that we would expect that that would continue on. I think what’s attractive about our offering is our open ecosystem. And I think that really resonates with the sovereign community. But to your original question, I think it’s an additive opportunity and it’s one that we believe will continue to be very important for us going forward with both MI-three 55 as well as the MI-four 100 series.

<a id="post-16"></a>
[16] **Vivek Arya, Analyst, Bank of America Securities** Vivek Arya, Analyst, Bank of America Securities: And for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about gross margins for your MI product. So I understand in the early days, right, it has been dilutive. What kind of sales level is required for it to start becoming, you know, additive to margins? And let’s say if I fast forward to Q4 and assume that, you know, your Q4 sales are growing year on year roughly the same rate as Q3 sales, Should we expect gross margins to kind of stay at these Q3 levels? Or are there other plusminus drivers we should think about in terms of gross margins as you go into Q4? Thank you.

<a id="post-17"></a>
[17] **Jean Hu, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, AMD** Jean Hu, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, AMD: Yes. Vivek, thank you for the question. The gross margin of our MI product, we said it’s a little bit below corporate average. I think at this point, our priority is really to address the larger, faster growing revenue opportunities that we have and provide customers the better TCO to really expand our presence in the marketplace. I think that the way to think about our gross margin, there are different dynamics, right, different customers, different generations. But also our operation team has been continuing to really drive operational efficiency to improve our MI family’s gross margin. That has been ongoing. So it’s not necessarily really tied to, okay, the revenue level each quarter, but you should think about is a trend in the longer term, it should improve continually going forward. Overall, the way I think about these gross margin dollars, right, this is one of the fastest growing market opportunities for any financial metrics, gross margin dollars is what we try to grab as much as we can. Hopefully, that helped your question.

<a id="post-18"></a>
[18] **Conference Operator** Conference Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.

<a id="post-19"></a>
[19] **Timothy Arcuri, Analyst, UBS** Timothy Arcuri, Analyst, UBS: Thanks a lot. Lisa, so my question is on data center GPU. You did say that June is up year over year, so it sounds like it’s maybe a little more than $1,000,000,000 And you use words like strong ramp into the back half of the year. Can you give us just any color on what that means? Can you get to say $7,000,000,000 for the year? And can you give us some maybe a milepost on what you’re assuming for Q3 would be great?

<a id="post-20"></a>
[20] **Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD** Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD: Yes. Thanks, Tim, for the question. I think what we said in the prepared remarks is that we are seeing a strong ramp from Q2 into Q3. MI-three fifty five, we actually started production in June. So we had some shipments in sort of in the month of June, but it really is ramping as we go through this quarter and the third quarter. So in terms of guideposts, we said it would grow year on year from last year and that I think is a strong ramp. And then we would expect it to grow into the fourth quarter as well. The demand, I should say, what we’re seeing from customers is, I think, really positive around MI 355. Sort of the way I would contrast it with maybe the MI 300 ramp, I think MI 300 started with perhaps some smaller deployments. I think what we’re seeing with MI355 is very competitive versus the B200, GB200 family of products. I think there’s a strong desire to really use us at scale. The MI-three 55 is very strong for inferencing. We’re also working with a number of customers on training. And this is also an opportunity for us to build into the MI-four 100 series as we go into 2026. So we’re bullish on MI-three 55 and where the AI opportunity is for us. And I think we’re right on track to what we expected to be as we were going through the development of the roadmap.

<a id="post-21"></a>
[21] **Timothy Arcuri, Analyst, UBS** Timothy Arcuri, Analyst, UBS: Thanks a lot. And then Lisa, just on that point also, you did talk about a new developer cloud. So, obviously, you’re beginning you’re, you know, beginning to lease back some of the, you know, capacity that you’re selling into the clouds and the neo clouds. Is that gonna be a material portion of the revenue you’re gonna recognize for MI $3.55 in the back half of the year? Can you just talk about that and maybe how to think about how much demand that’s going to stimulate and what the ultimate goal is for that cloud? Thanks.

<a id="post-22"></a>
[22] **Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD** Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD: Yeah, so there are a couple of things in that question. So let me answer. So the developer cloud is simply we want to make it super easy for developers to get on AMD Instinct GPUs. One could say, again, if we look back at the MI300 family, we were very focused on the largest hyperscalers and the largest customers. But there’s a lot of interest in our GPUs across a number of customers who just wanted easier access. And so by ensuring that developer cloud is there, that it has ready to deploy containers, you can run training and inference easily, you don’t necessarily have to make longer term commitments. I think that’s the purpose of the Developer Cloud. I don’t think it adds meaningfully to revenue in the second half of the year, but it certainly adds to customers getting experience with AMD. I think the larger revenue opportunities for us are really with large customer adoption as they ramp to larger deployments. And we’re very actively trying to get those deployments up and running as soon as possible. One of the things just as a reminder that the MI355 is, given that it’s similar a infrastructure to MI300, we actually think it’s going to ramp very quickly and very well for customers. And I think that’s one of the attractive portions of it as well.

<a id="post-23"></a>
[23] **Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD** Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD: Thank you, Matt, and good afternoon to all those listening today. We delivered very strong second quarter results with revenue exceeding the midpoint of guidance as higher EPYC and Ryzen processor sales more than offset headwinds from export controls that impacted Instinct sales. We set records for both EPYC and Ryzen CPU sales, reflecting the broad based demand for our differentiated high performance data center, PC and embedded processors. Second quarter revenue increased 32% year over year to a record $7,700,000,000 and we delivered over $1,000,000,000 in free cash flow. Excluding the $800,000,000 inventory write down related to data center AI export controls, gross margin was 54, marking our sixth consecutive quarter of year over year margin expansion led by a richer product mix. Turning to the segments, Data Center segment revenue increased 14% year over year to 3,200,000,000.0 We saw robust demand across our EPYC portfolio to power cloud and enterprise workloads and increasingly for emerging AI use cases. In particular, adoption of AgenTeq AI is creating additional demand for general purpose compute infrastructure as customers quickly realize that each token generated by a GPU triggers multiple CPU intensive tasks. Against this backdrop, fifth gen EPYC TURN shipments ramped significantly and we had sustained demand for our prior generation EPYC processors. As a result, we set records for both cloud and enterprise CPU sales and delivered our thirty third consecutive quarter of year over year share gains. In cloud, adoption expanded with the largest hyperscalers as they deployed Epic to power more of their mission critical infrastructure, services and public cloud products. More than 100 new AMD powered cloud instances launched in the quarter, including multiple Turin instances from Google and Oracle Cloud that deliver up to twice the performance of our previous generation, which were already the industry’s highest performing offerings. There are now nearly 1,200 EPYC Cloud instances available globally as providers continue expanding both the breadth and regional availability of their AMD offerings. This continued expansion is accelerating enterprise adoption of Epic in the cloud with deployments growing significantly from the prior quarter as we closed large wins with dozens of large aerospace streaming, financial services, retail and energy companies. EPYC adoption also grew with telecom customers as providers modernize their infrastructure for next generation networks. For example, KDDI announced plans to deploy EPYC processors to power its five gs virtualized network. And Nokia selected Epic for its cloud platform used by service providers to build, deploy and manage core network functions. Turning to enterprise on prem adoption, HPE, Dell, Lenovo and Super Micro launched 28 new TURN platforms in the quarter that deliver leadership performance, efficiency and TCO across a wide range of enterprise workloads. EPIC enterprise deployments grew significantly from the prior quarter, supported by new wins with large technology, automotive, manufacturing, financial services and public sector customers. To extend our momentum with SMB and hosted IT service customers, we launched the EPYC 4,005 series that combine enterprise grade performance and features in cost optimized platforms, purpose built for smaller scale deployments. Turning to HPC, AMD now powers more than one third of the world’s fastest supercomputers, including El Capitan and Frontier, which retained the number one and number two spots on the latest top 500 list. We also powered 12 of the top 20 systems on the green 500, highlighting the performance per watt advantages of EPYC and Instinct for large scale deployments. Looking ahead, we remain bullish on our server CPU business, driven by durable tailwinds, including growing demand for cloud and on prem compute, sustained share gains and the growing investments in general purpose infrastructure required to enable AI. Turning to our Data Center AI business, revenue declined year over year as U. S. Export restrictions effectively eliminated MI-three zero eight sales to China and we began transitioning to our next generation MI-three 50 series accelerators.

[24] **Conference Operator** Conference Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.

<a id="post-25"></a>
[25] **Ross Seymore, Analyst, Deutsche Bank** Ross Seymore, Analyst, Deutsche Bank: Hi, thanks for letting me ask a question. Lisa, want to go back to the instinct side of things and the MI 355 ramp. It looks like the second half is going to ramp really significantly. You said it’s going to be up year over year in the third quarter. I believe a quarter ago, you said roughly the same thing, and the MI-three 08 is out of both numbers, so that shouldn’t really matter, and I guess it would be upside. But I just wondered how have things changed from a quarter ago as far as the MI-three 50 family adoption, especially because you launched a little bit early. Is the growth a little bit more than you would have expected a quarter ago, about the same or a little worse? Just any sort of color on that would be helpful.

<a id="post-26"></a>
[26] **Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD** Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD: Yes, Ross, thanks for the question. I think the main thing I would say is, I think the adoption is a bit faster than we might have expected. Again, whenever you launch a product, we want to make sure that we go through the full validation and all of that with our customers. I think there’s a lot of interest, broad based interest in MI-three 55. And so I feel like over the last ninety days, I think we’ve had significant sort of new customer interest and that’s certainly positive. Will say, I’m sorry, Ross, I was just going to add, our engagements are, I think the other pieces, I think there’s also a lot of excitement around MI-four Hundred and what we can do with the Helios rack. And so there are a number of customers who based on sort of the strong roadmap that we’re showing, to get familiar and really work with us earlier in the life cycle, which I think is again positive.

<a id="post-27"></a>
[27] **Ross Seymore, Analyst, Deutsche Bank** Ross Seymore, Analyst, Deutsche Bank: Great, thank you for that. I guess as my follow-up, an earlier question you talked about a little bit below seasonality in the second half of the year for your client business. It seems like there’s just I don’t even know if seasonality is a framework that matters, but how are you thinking about that for the second half as a whole for a client? And then gaming was just up a huge amount sequentially in the second quarter. You described a little bit of what you’re expecting there. But how do you think about seasonality for the second half in its entirety in the gaming side as well?

<a id="post-28"></a>
[28] **Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD** Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD: Yes, let me try and then Jean might add if you want a little bit more color. So the way to think about it is, we do expect some growth sequential growth in clients as we go into the third quarter. I would say, sort of single digit type growth. We continue to see good traction for our products in that portfolio. On the gaming side, I would call it flattish to Q2. And we’re coming off of such a strong Q2 that I think flattish is actually to be expected. As we go into the fourth quarter, the dynamics that we would see is, we would see that the console business would actually be down substantially. So think about it as down strong double digits. The customers usually build for the holiday season sort of before that and then that will be completed by the fourth quarter. So we would expect as the client and gaming segment that the segment would probably be down in the fourth quarter. So hopefully that helps. Jean, did you want to add to that?

<a id="post-29"></a>
[29] **Jean Hu, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, AMD** Jean Hu, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, AMD: No, I think you covered it. And

<a id="post-30"></a>
[30] **Conference Operator** Conference Operator: the next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.

<a id="post-31"></a>
[31] **Joshua Buchalter, Analyst, TD Cowen** Joshua Buchalter, Analyst, TD Cowen: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about lead times on your on the Instinct family both for the MI three fifty group family and MI 400. I mean, as you move into larger cluster sizes, which it sounds like you’re doing at least with Oracle on three fifty and then endeavor to do more so on 400, how much visibility and lead time do you need from your customers? Because I would imagine the lead time for your parts is measured in months, but on the infrastructure side in particular for the larger scale deployments, I mean, those things are measured in years at this point. So maybe you could speak to the visibility specifically on the 400. Thank you.

<a id="post-32"></a>
[32] **Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD** Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD: Yes, sure, Josh. So, yes, I mean, our lead times are long given all of the processing steps that we have to go through. Think about it as somewhere between eight, nine months, that type of thing. We have a very, very strong supply chain. We’ve been preparing for these ramps of both MI350 series and MI400 series, and that preparation is ongoing. So, we feel like we have a very strong supply chain there. In terms of visibility with customers, we’re absolutely working with customers very closely on near term MI350 Series deployments, getting those deployments up as quickly as possible. Again, one of the things about the MI350 series that is good is that it can go into existing data centers, just given the platform that it is in. So we have been certainly working with our customers there. And then for the MI400 series, there are lots and lots of details sort of full rack scale design implementation and we’re actively working with the largest customers right now on just ensuring that our Helios rack is fully compatible with their data center build outs as we go into 2026. So that visibility is important. I think that co development, co engineering is important as we get into the RackScale architecture. And the ZT team that we brought in has been extremely, extremely helpful in terms of both internal platform build out as well as ensuring that we’re working closely with our customers on their data center needs.

<a id="post-33"></a>
[33] **Joshua Buchalter, Analyst, TD Cowen** Joshua Buchalter, Analyst, TD Cowen: Thank you for that, Lisa. Maybe for Gene, I wanted to follow-up on Vivek’s question earlier on gross margins. So if we add back the charges in 2Q and then your gross margin implied in the guidance is roughly flat sequentially. And that’s despite what’s implied to be data center GPUs up meaningfully sequentially. Like it doesn’t seem like console is falling off in the third quarter. I mean, you maybe talk to the underlying drivers of how you’re able to keep the flat gross margins despite what sounds like still margin dilutive data center GPUs up significantly within the mix? Thank you.

<a id="post-34"></a>
[34] **Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD** We made solid progress with MI300 and MI325 in the quarter, closing new wins and expanding adoption with Tier one customers, next generation AI cloud providers and end users. Today, seven of the top 10 model builders and AI companies use Instinct, underscoring the performance and TCO advantages of our data center AI solutions. We launched our Instinct MI350 series with industry leading memory bandwidth and capacity and broad adoption across hyperscalers, AI companies and OEMs. From a competitive standpoint, MI355 matches or exceeds B200 in critical training and inference workloads and delivers comparable performance to GB200 for key workloads at significantly lower cost and complexity. For at scale inferencing, MI355 delivers up to 40% more tokens per dollar, providing leadership performance and clear TCO advantages. With the MI three fifty series, we’re also expanding our system level capabilities to support deployments powered by AMD CPUs, GPUs and NICs. As one example, Oracle is building a 27,000 plus node AI cluster combining MI355 X Accelerators, fifth Gen EPYC TURN CPUs and Polarra 400 SmartNICs. We began volume production of the MI350 Series ahead of schedule in June and expect a steep production ramp in the second half of the year to support large scale production deployments with multiple customers. Our sovereign AI engagements accelerated in the quarter as governments around the world adopt AMD technology to build secure AI infrastructure and advance their economies. As one example, we announced a multibillion dollar collaboration with Humane to build AI infrastructure powered entirely on AMD CPUs, GPUs and software. Initial deployments are underway in key regions with quarterly expansions planned over the coming years. In addition, we have more than 40 active engagements globally and see significant opportunities to power an increasingly larger portion of national computing centers and sovereign AI initiatives. On the AI software front, we made significant progress this quarter, increasing the performance, improving the usability and expanding the adoption of ROCCM. We announced ROCCM seven with major upgrades across every layer of the stack, delivering more than 3x higher inferencing and training performance compared to our prior generation and adding support for large scale training, distributed inference and lower precision data types. To deepen developer engagement, we introduced nightly ROCCM builds and expanded access to instant compute infrastructure, including launching our first developer cloud that provides pre configured containers for instant access to AMD GPUs. We also expanded native support for ROCCM across key frameworks, including VLLM and SGLANG, enabling frontier models like LAMA-four, Gemma-three and DeepSeek R1 to launch with DayZero AMD support. To accelerate enterprise adoption, we introduced Rockham Enterprise AI, a full stack platform that integrates seamlessly with existing IT infrastructure and includes everything needed for an enterprise to deploy, manage and scale AI across their business. Looking ahead, the development of our next generation MI400 series is progressing rapidly. These are the most advanced GPUs we have ever built with up to 40 petaflops of FP4 AI performance and 50% more memory, memory bandwidth and scale out throughput than the competition. With the MI400 series, we’re bringing together everything we’ve learned across silicon software and systems to deliver Helios, a full stack rack scale AI platform.

<a id="post-35"></a>
[35] **Jean Hu, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, AMD** Jean Hu, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, AMD: Yes. Justin, thanks for the question. Yes, we are guiding our Q3 gross margin around 54%. And Q2, you’re right, excluding the $800,000,000 charge, was close to 54%. I think the gaming business actually is quite high. So the mix actually is unfavorable. But we do have some tailwinds that we have been really driving. First is we have been expanding our server business, which has really nice gross margin. And then on the client business side, we are expanding the commercial PC business. So that really helps us to drive the gross margin up. In addition, we do have a really strong operational team. They are driving the gross margin improvement just from operational efficiency perspective across the board. So overall, our objective is to continue to improve gross margin despite MI350 very strong ramp in Q3, we are able to continue to drive the margin up.

<a id="post-36"></a>
[36] **Conference Operator** Conference Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.

<a id="post-37"></a>
[37] **Matthew Ramsey, VP of Investor Relations and Financial Strategy, AMD0** Matthew Ramsey, VP of Investor Relations and Financial Strategy, AMD0: Great, thank you. You’ve used this language before of the kind of tens of billions opportunity around MI-four hundred. Can you talk about the timeframe when that might occur and not to pin you down too much, but and what would help you get to that level sooner rather than later? Should we think of that as a 2027 realistic outcome that you could be looking at 20,000,000,000 plus? Just a little bit more color on that tens of billions comment.

<a id="post-38"></a>
[38] **Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD** Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD: Yeah, I mean, maybe without being specific, Joe, I can give you sort of the way I look at it and back to this notion of, are we incrementally more confident? I think we’re seeing a lot of positive signs in our AI customer adoption. I think the strength of the MI350 series, the very positive feedback that we’re getting on MI400 from customers, the work that we’re doing in terms of ensuring that we are fully ready for large scale deployments of not just inference, but training. I think when we get to tens of billions of dollars, we’re talking about significant gigawatt scale type deployments. And those would be important for us to get there. And we’re certainly, I think, engaged with all of the right customers that can enable that type of ramp. But I won’t necessarily speculate on the exact time other than to say, certainly that would be our set of aspirations.

<a id="post-39"></a>
[39] **Matthew Ramsey, VP of Investor Relations and Financial Strategy, AMD0** Matthew Ramsey, VP of Investor Relations and Financial Strategy, AMD0: Great, that’s helpful. Thank you. And then as these workloads evolve, I mean, you’ve sort of talked about inference and training as sort of different opportunities for AMD. Are you seeing those start to come together? It seems like with inference, the reasoning models are requiring much higher complexity.

<a id="post-40"></a>
[40] **Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD** Is rack scale more important to the inference market than you thought it might be? Just any color around how that complexity of inference is impacting you guys? Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD: Yeah, think that’s absolutely true, Joe. I think with the proliferation of models, I think what we’re seeing is GPUs continue to be very sort of the computing of choice as you think about all the models that are out there. And then as you go into distributed inference and some of the newer techniques, we are seeing the importance of the scale up and scale out architecture, which we are investing in. But I think the overarching thing is, think we have a very competitive roadmap across the next couple of generations. I think that has now gotten strong customer validation. We’re getting a lot of feedback from customers on where they would like to see us continue to add more resources and add more focus. And so that is very helpful. And the key is to be a full scale solution provider for these large customer deployments. That’s what we’re working on.

<a id="post-41"></a>
[41] **Conference Operator** Conference Operator: And the next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.

<a id="post-42"></a>
[42] **Analyst, Wells Fargo** Analyst, Wells Fargo: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I do have a follow-up as well. I guess the first question is, when we look at the data center guide, Gene, you had alluded to double digit sequential growth. Obviously, the MI three fifty five series kind of ramping. I’m curious, how could we conceptualize what you’re expecting in the server side? And where do you think your market share is today in traditional enterprise servers outside of cloud?

<a id="post-43"></a>
[43] **Jean Hu, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, AMD** Jean Hu, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, AMD: Yes. I think when you look at our data center business, we do have a strong double digit growth, both the server and MI both sides are growing sequentially. Of course, MI ramp is the most significant one. As far as the server market share, we do think we continue to drive the market share up compared to Q1. Not a third party has not published a report yet, but we feel really good about the Q2 market share increase versus Q1.

<a id="post-44"></a>
[44] **Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD** Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD: Erin, if I just add to that, one of the things that it’s important for people to understand is in some of the cloud CapEx numbers that have come out that have been quite positive, That is not only a GPU statement, but there’s actually significant CPU CapEx in there as well. We’ve started to see more robust forecasts going out a number of quarters on the server CPU side, because all of that AI content really requires traditional CPUs as well. And so we’re very bullish on the opportunity in servers. I think the team has really executed extremely well. I mean, if you look at our portfolio now, Turin and Genoa are very well adopted, broadening workloads. Enterprise adoption is also increasing. And so I think all of those are positive for the server opportunity in the 2025, as well as going into 2026 and beyond.

<a id="post-45"></a>
[45] **Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD** Helios is purpose built for the most demanding AI workloads with each rack connecting up to 72 GPUs that can operate as a single massive AI accelerator. Helios is expected to deliver up to a 10x generational performance increase for the most advanced frontier models. And we believe it will be the highest performance AI system in the world when it launches. MI-four 100 series development is progressing well towards our planned launch in 2026 with significant interest in large scale deployments from multiple high profile customers. To accelerate our development, we have invested significantly to expand our AI software and hardware capabilities, both organically and inorganically with a number of acquisitions and strategic investments. We strengthened our software stack last quarter with the addition of the Brium and Lamini teams, building on our acquisitions of Nod dot ai, Nipsology and Silo dot ai. On the hardware side, we added a world class rack and data center scale design team in the second quarter with our acquisition of ZT Systems. The ZT team is integrated seamlessly and they are actively engaging with multiple customers to accelerate deployments of our Helios solutions at scale. We also announced last quarter that Sannina intends to acquire ZT’s U. S. Based manufacturing business, becoming our lead partner for AI rack manufacturing. Turning to the AI regulatory environment, earlier this quarter, we were notified by the Department of Commerce that it is moving forward with the review of our license applications to export MI-three zero eight to China. We appreciate the focus the Trump administration is placing on assuring that The U. S. Technology remains central to global AI infrastructure and we expect to resume MI-three zero eight shipments as licenses are approved subject to end customer demand and supply chain readiness.

<a id="post-46"></a>
[46] **Analyst, Wells Fargo** Analyst, Wells Fargo: Yeah. And then as a follow-up, I’m kind of thinking about the China, the MI-three zero eight opportunity. When we do see a license, I think you alluded to this earlier, it’s going to take a little bit of time to kind of ramp and get the supply chain to satisfy the demand. But I’m curious, the 800,000,000 write down that you had taken, is there no kind of finished inventory there? Does that come back? Do you have any reversal aspects of that once a license gets approved?

<a id="post-47"></a>
[47] **Jean Hu, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, AMD** Jean Hu, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, AMD: Let me start first, then Lisa First, on the $800,000,000 majority of them are WIPs. We really don’t have on the shelf finished goods that we can ship immediately. So we do need to take time if we get a license. That’s perfect.

<a id="post-48"></a>
[48] **Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD** Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD: Yeah, thank you.

<a id="post-49"></a>
[49] **Conference Operator** Conference Operator: And the next question comes from the line of C. J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.

<a id="post-50"></a>
[50] **Matthew Ramsey, VP of Investor Relations and Financial Strategy, AMD1** Matthew Ramsey, VP of Investor Relations and Financial Strategy, AMD1: Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess Lisa was hoping you could level set us on the instinct ramp into 2026. How are thinking about the timing of the handoff three fifty to four hundred? How are you thinking about Helios contributions? And I guess very importantly from a customer contribution perspective, how you might see that evolve from traditional hyperscalers to perhaps more sovereign and Neo Cloud within the mix?

<a id="post-51"></a>
[51] **Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD** Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD: Sure, CJ. So certainly as second half this year, it’s all about MI three fifty five ramp into first half of next year. I think the MI 400 series development is right on track. The development of the Helios platform is also right on track. We would expect significant revenue contribution from Helios in 2026. And then relative to the contribution of the various things hyperscalers, sort of some of the versus Neo Clouds versus Sovereign. I think it’s a little early to really talk about the different pieces other than to say, you would expect that hyperscalers and let’s call it Neo Clouds that would be working for other large AI natives, maybe significant pieces of the initial ramp. And then sovereign may come a little bit later in time, just given sort of the timing of when different build outs would happen. So hopefully that gives you some color, CJ.

<a id="post-52"></a>
[52] **Matthew Ramsey, VP of Investor Relations and Financial Strategy, AMD1** Matthew Ramsey, VP of Investor Relations and Financial Strategy, AMD1: Yes, very helpful. And then Jean, I guess a question for you with the sale of ZT for $3,000,000,000 of cash and stock and you only have $3,000,000,000 of debt outstanding. How are you thinking about the use of proceeds? Is there saving for a rainy day or bolt on acquisitions, perhaps more aggressive share buyback? How are you thinking about it today?

<a id="post-53"></a>
[53] **Jean Hu, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, AMD** Jean Hu, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, AMD: Yes, thanks for the question. Our business model actually generate a lot of free cash flow as you see in Q2, free cash flow generation was $1,200,000,000 So if we close the ZT sale and we’ll get more cash. Overall, our capital allocation principle continue to be the first things investing, especially with the tremendous AI opportunities ahead of us. And then we’ll continue to return cash to shareholders. We did a $1,200,000,000 repurchase in the first half of the year.

[56] **Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD** As our licenses are still under review, we are not including any MI-three zero eight revenue in our third quarter guidance. Despite that, we expect Instinct revenue to grow year over year in the third quarter, driven by the ramp of MI350 at multiple customers. In Clients and Gaming, segment revenue increased 69% year over year to 3,600,000,000 driven by record client CPU sales and strong demand for our semi custom game console SoCs and Radeon GPUs. Client revenue increased 67% year over year to $2,500,000,000 led by record desktop CPU sales. Demand for our latest generation Ryzen 9,000 series was strong, especially for our differentiated X3D processors. We delivered record desktop channel CPU sales as Ryzen processors consistently topped the best selling CPU lists at major global e tailers throughout the quarter. We also expanded our Zen five desktop portfolio with the launch of our latest Threadripper processors that feature up to 96 cores and deliver up to double the performance of the competition in many popular content creation and design workloads. In mobile, demand for AMD powered notebooks was strong with sellout growing by a large double digit percentage year over year. We drove a richer mix of higher ASP mobile parts year over year as we expanded our share in the premium notebook segment, where our Ryzen AI 300 CPUs deliver leadership performance and value for both general purpose and AI workloads. In commercial PCs, Ryzen adoption accelerated as OEM consumption increased more than 25% year over year. We saw a strong sell through for AMD commercial notebooks with Lenovo and HP and a significant uptick in Dell sales as they ramp availability of their AMD commercial portfolio. We also closed new enterprise wins with Forbes two thousand pharma, tech, automotive, financial services, aerospace and healthcare companies. We expect continue growing our commercial client share based on the strength of our product portfolio and expanded breadth of OEM offerings. Looking more broadly, we remain confident we can continue growing client processor revenue ahead of the market over the coming quarters, driven by increased adoption of our desktop and notebook products, growing commercial momentum and a richer product mix. In gaming, revenue increased 73% year over year to 1,100,000,000.0 Semi custom revenue increased by a large double digit percentage year over year as console inventories normalized and our customers began preparing for the holiday season.

[57] **Matthew Ramsey, VP of Investor Relations and Financial Strategy, AMD2** Matthew Ramsey, VP of Investor Relations and Financial Strategy, AMD2: Hey, thanks for squeaking me in here. I wanted to clarify a little bit on the $1,000,000,000 increase in sequential sales. It would seem like it’s coming from GPUs primarily. I was wondering if you could back that. And that’s with nothing in China. And if the answer to the prior question that GPUs are over $1,000,000,000 that kind of puts you at a $2,000,000,000 run rate. And I was just wondering if that was accurate in terms of thinking. And then I have just a very quick follow-up. Thanks.

<a id="post-58"></a>
[58] **Jean Hu, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, AMD** Jean Hu, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, AMD: Hi, Ben. Thanks for the question. If you look at the sequential revenue increase, as I mentioned during the prepared remarks, we see data center strong double digit increase, which include both GPU and the CPU, but the GPU definitely drives largest incremental amount increase. We also mentioned the client actually is going to increase sequentially. In addition, the embedded business will return to sequential growth. So multiple business contributed to sequential increase, but the majority of increase is really driven by MI three fifty five with a strong ramp.

<a id="post-59"></a>
[59] **Matthew Ramsey, VP of Investor Relations and Financial Strategy, AMD2** Matthew Ramsey, VP of Investor Relations and Financial Strategy, AMD2: Okay, great. And then if indeed that gets you pretty close to a couple billion dollars, if the MI-three 100 comes in, do you see it at the same run rate that you exited? And then you have the ability to get at that 800 mil run rate right away? Or you think it will take several quarters to ramp when you get the license? Thanks.

<a id="post-60"></a>
[60] **Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD** Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD: Yeah, Ben, it will take some time to ramp just given particularly today. I mean, we’re sitting already in early August. So I don’t think you would see a lot of it in Q3. But certainly, as licenses would be approved, would schedule that and it would take a little while to ramp.

<a id="post-61"></a>
[61] **Matthew Ramsey, VP of Investor Relations and Financial Strategy, AMD** Matthew Ramsey, VP of Investor Relations and Financial Strategy, AMD: All right, operator, thank you very much. We appreciate everybody that joined the call today and we just like to end the call now. Thank you.

<a id="post-62"></a>
[62] **Conference Operator** Conference Operator: Yep, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today’s teleconference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

<a id="post-63"></a>
[63] **Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD** We announced a new multi year collaboration with Microsoft for custom chips that will power the next generation of Xbox devices, including consoles, PCs and handhelds. We also deepened our collaboration with Sony through Project Amethyst, a co engineering program that will use machine learning to power the next wave of immersive gaming experiences. In PC gaming, demand for our latest generation Radeon 9,000 series GPUs was very strong with desktop GPU sell through accelerating in the quarter as demand outpaced supply. We launched the Radeon 9,600 XT extending the performance advantages of RDNA four to mainstream gamers and delivering a significant uplift in gaming performance, including more than double the ray tracing of our prior generation. As part of our end to end AI strategy, we introduced the Radeon AI Pro R9700 GPU for local inferencing, model fine tuning and other data intensive workloads. The R9700 features more memory, full ROCCM support and multi GPU scalability, enabling advanced AI development and deployment directly on the desktop. Turning to our Embedded segment, revenue decreased 4% year over year to $824,000,000 Demand continues recovering gradually with sell through in the second quarter picking up as strength in most markets was offset by a few pockets of softness and inventory reduction actions, largely with industrial customers. We expanded our embedded portfolio with the first production shipments of Spartan UltraScale plus FPGAs that deliver leadership performance and advanced security for cost sensitive low power applications. Adoption of our Versal Adaptive SoCs continues expanding in high end applications, including next generation Robotaxi platforms developed by Bosch in Europe, where Versal serves as a high performance controller, enabling real time processing, security and encryption in fully electric automated vehicles. Looking ahead, we expect improving demand in the test and measurement, communications and aerospace markets will drive a return to sequential growth in the 2025.

<a id="post-64"></a>
[64] **Lisa Su, Chair and Chief Executive Officer, AMD** Longer term, design win momentum continues to build tracking ahead of this point last year and putting us on pace to surpass the record $14,000,000,000 in design wins we achieved in 2024. In summary, demand is very strong across our product portfolio and we are well positioned to deliver significant growth in the second half of the year, led by the steep ramp of MI350 Series accelerators and ongoing EPYC and Ryzen share gains. Our server and PC CPU businesses are accelerating, driven by growing demand for high performance compute, sustained share gains, the strength of our product portfolio and expanded go to market investments. Our embedded and gaming businesses are returning to growth and are well positioned for long term success supported by strong design win momentum. And in AI, we are seeing strong adoption of our MI350 Series and ROCCM seven as we deliver leadership performance and TCO advantages across a broader range of workloads and ramp deployments with an expanded set of cloud and enterprise customers. Looking ahead, we see a clear path to scaling our AI business to tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue. We are very excited about our next generation MI400 series, which is another giant step forward on our roadmap and has been designed to deliver leadership performance at the chip, server and rack levels. Customer interest for the MI-four 100 series is very strong and we’re actively engaging with an expanding set of customers to support large scale deployments in 2026. We are in the early stages of an industry wide AI transformation that will drive a step function increase in compute demand across all of our markets, positioning us for significant revenue and earnings growth over the coming years. Now I’d like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our second quarter results. Jean?

<a id="post-65"></a>
[65] **Jean Hu, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, AMD** Jean Hu, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, AMD: Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I’ll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our outlook for the 2025. We are pleased with our strong second quarter financial results. We delivered record revenue of 7,700,000,000.0 exceeding the midpoint of our guidance, up 32% year over year, reflecting strong momentum across our business. Record sales of Ryzen and EPYC processors and the higher semi customer shipment more than offset the impact of The U. S. Export controls, restricting MI308 sales to China. Revenue increased 3% sequentially due to strong growth in the client and the gaming segment, partially offset by the data center revenue decrease due to export controls. Gross margin was 43%, down 10 points from 53% a year ago. The decrease was due to the $800,000,000 inventory and the related charges associated with the export restrictions. Excluding this charge, non GAAP gross margin would have been approximately 54%. Operating expenses were approximately $2,400,000,000 an increase of 32% year over year as we continue to invest aggressively in go to market activities for revenue growth and in R and D to capitalize on significant future AI expansion opportunities. Operating income was $897,000,000 representing a 12% operating margin compared to $1,300,000,000 or 22% a year ago. The decline was primarily due to the inventory and the related charges. Taxes, interest expense and other totaled 126,000,000 For the 2025, diluted earnings per share were $0.48 compared to $0.69 a year ago.
