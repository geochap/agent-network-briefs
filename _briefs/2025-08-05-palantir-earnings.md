## Executive Summary

Palantir’s Q2 2025 print reframed expectations for AI platform scale economics: the company crossed $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, with 48% year-over-year growth, a 46% adjusted operating margin, and a Rule of 40 score of 94. Management raised full‑year guidance and emphasized accelerating U.S. momentum—particularly in commercial—alongside record TCV bookings. For investors, the immediate stakes center on durability: can Palantir sustain a rare blend of hypergrowth and profitability while broadening beyond a heavily U.S.-centric mix and converting headline bookings to high‑quality, recognized revenue and cash flows over time? [[14]](#post-14) [[12]](#post-12) [[20]](#post-20)

There is growing convergence that Palantir’s ontology‑driven AIP is a real differentiator versus standalone LLMs, with embedded engineering and frontline co‑development cited as catalysts for faster time‑to‑value and compounding “learning loops.” This is echoed by management’s positioning and by field evidence of large, rapid expansions, which together support the current growth arc. At the same time, rapid onboarding can accrue hidden technical debt, and trust/oversight gaps—especially in healthcare and defense—remain unresolved given a lack of regular third‑party algorithmic audits. These tensions make end‑user adoption depth, override behavior, and longitudinal performance critical metrics to watch beyond early wins. [[12]](#post-12) [[13]](#post-13) [[47]](#post-47) [[38]](#post-38) [[26]](#post-26) [[22]](#post-22) [[25]](#post-25) [[37]](#post-37) [[33]](#post-33) [[46]](#post-46) [[58]](#post-58) [[59]](#post-59)

Risk is most concentrated where growth is strongest: the U.S. now represents roughly 73% of revenue, propelled by a powerful U.S. commercial surge and reinforced by large U.S. government awards (e.g., Army enterprise, Maven ceiling increases). This deep alignment with U.S. defense and policy priorities supports near‑term momentum but also heightens exposure to appropriations cycles, regulatory shifts, and geopolitical backlash that could complicate expansion across foreign blocs—especially as international commercial declined year over year. The strategic question is whether Palantir can sustain its trajectory while reducing single‑jurisdiction and public‑sector dependency. [[12]](#post-12) [[14]](#post-14) [[21]](#post-21) [[23]](#post-23) [[24]](#post-24) [[36]](#post-36) [[49]](#post-49)

Finally, the quality of growth versus the optics of bookings remains a central tension. Record TCV bolsters visibility, yet disclosure limits around termination‑for‑convenience, revenue schedules, and contract‑level ASC 606 recognition complicate assessments of durability and cash conversion; RPO also understates government exposure due to common contract structures. Palantir’s product‑led motion—eschewing a large direct salesforce—creates speed and credibility with builders, but can risk slower feedback capture during complex integrations. The company’s cash and free‑cash‑flow position provides meaningful optionality against these execution and concentration risks. Near‑term watch items: sustained non‑U.S. growth, evidence of deep frontline adoption over time, clearer booking‑to‑revenue conversion, and independent AI audits in sensitive domains.

## Cross-Theme Interactions

### **Quality of Hypergrowth: Rule of 40, Mix Shift, and Customer Diversification ↔ Ontology-Driven AIP as Moat: Frontline Learning Loops and Embedded Engineering**

Palantir’s sector-leading Rule of 40 (94) and 48% YoY revenue growth with a 46% adjusted operating margin are explicitly tied by management to the ontology‑centric AIP stack, which they argue is necessary to make LLMs useful in production settings; rapid “land‑and‑expand” examples (Citibank KYC in seconds, Fannie Mae fraud detection in seconds, Nebraska Medicine throughput gains) and record TCV book‑ins reinforce that product differentiation is directly powering the mix shift toward U.S. commercial hypergrowth (93% YoY) and broader customer expansion (849 customers, up 43% YoY) [[14]](#post-14) [[12]](#post-12) [[13]](#post-13).

### **Quality of Hypergrowth: Rule of 40, Mix Shift, and Customer Diversification ↔ U.S. Government Concentration and Geopolitical Exposure**

The growth surge is disproportionately U.S.-driven (73% of revenue; U.S. up 68% YoY), with outsized contributions from U.S. government programs (e.g., Army enterprise agreement up to $10B, Maven ceiling increase) and U.S. commercial acceleration; this concentration elevates exposure to U.S. policy cycles and potential geopolitical pushback while international commercial declined 3% YoY, underlining the diversification challenge flagged by political‑risk perspectives [[14]](#post-14) [[12]](#post-12) [[24]](#post-24) [[36]](#post-36) [[49]](#post-49).

### **Quality of Hypergrowth: Rule of 40, Mix Shift, and Customer Diversification ↔ TCV Headlines vs. Revenue Recognition: Accounting Transparency and Contract Durability**

Record TCV ($2.3B), 42 deals ≥$10M, and rising top‑20 customer spend bolster perceived durability, yet disclosure gaps—RPO exclusions for common government terms, unspecified shares of termination‑for‑convenience exposure, and no contract‑level ASC 606 audit trails—complicate assessing how much headline growth converts into recognized revenue and cash in period [[14]](#post-14) [[27]](#post-27) [[39]](#post-39) [[44]](#post-44) [[52]](#post-52) [[53]](#post-53).

### **Quality of Hypergrowth: Rule of 40, Mix Shift, and Customer Diversification ↔ Frontline Adoption, Trust, and AI Safety in Healthcare and Defense**

Management’s growth narrative leans on fast frontline wins (e.g., bootcamp to $88M TCV in a month; Nebraska Medicine discharge throughput), but rapid rollouts carry risk of hidden technical debt and uneven adoption, and the absence of regular third‑party audits in healthcare/defense leaves a trust and safety gap that could affect sustained usage quality over time [[12]](#post-12) [[22]](#post-22) [[25]](#post-25) [[33]](#post-33) [[46]](#post-46) [[59]](#post-59).

### **Ontology-Driven AIP as Moat: Frontline Learning Loops and Embedded Engineering ↔ Product-Led Growth Without a Large Salesforce: Feedback and Integration Risks**

AIP’s ontology and embedded engineering motion enable rapid co‑development and replatforming (customers “building on AIP”), supporting product‑led adoption with minimal traditional sales; however, while this boosts speed and fit, limited direct sales coverage can slow discovery/escalation of usability frictions in complex integrations—an execution risk noted alongside the benefits of field‑embedded engineers [[13]](#post-13) [[2]](#post-2) [[47]](#post-47) [[34]](#post-34).

### **Ontology-Driven AIP as Moat: Frontline Learning Loops and Embedded Engineering ↔ U.S. Government Concentration and Geopolitical Exposure**

AIP’s differentiation is being validated in sensitive U.S. missions (Maven usage repeatedly doubling; Army enterprise consolidation), and leadership’s avowed U.S.-centric stance amplifies alignment with national programs; this strengthens domestic momentum even as it increases the probability of sovereignty‑driven barriers and political scrutiny abroad amid soft international commercial trends [[13]](#post-13) [[12]](#post-12) [[15]](#post-15) [[36]](#post-36) [[49]](#post-49) [[14]](#post-14).

### **U.S. Government Concentration and Geopolitical Exposure ↔ TCV Headlines vs. Revenue Recognition: Accounting Transparency and Contract Durability**

Heavy reliance on U.S. public‑sector awards magnifies the impact of government contracting mechanics: many agreements permit termination for convenience, RPO excludes obligations beyond such clauses, and Palantir does not disclose the proportion of TCV at risk—together, these factors increase uncertainty about future revenue recognition from today’s large bookings if appropriations or priorities shift [[14]](#post-14) [[44]](#post-44) [[27]](#post-27) [[39]](#post-39) [[21]](#post-21) [[23]](#post-23).

### **U.S. Government Concentration and Geopolitical Exposure ↔ Cash, Free Cash Flow, and Optionality for R&D, M&A, and Buybacks**

Palantir’s $6B cash and 57% adjusted FCF margin provide a buffer and strategic optionality (R&D, M&A, repurchases) against volatility inherent in U.S.-centric exposure to appropriations and geopolitical backlash, allowing continued investment even if certain public‑sector dynamics tighten [[42]](#post-42) [[35]](#post-35) [[24]](#post-24) [[21]](#post-21).

### **TCV Headlines vs. Revenue Recognition: Accounting Transparency and Contract Durability ↔ Product-Led Growth Without a Large Salesforce: Feedback and Integration Risks**

The product‑led model is producing high‑velocity expansions and many large deals (157 ≥$1M in Q2), but the lack of contract‑level revenue schedules and audit trails under ASC 606 obscures revenue timing—creating a reliance on internal execution and customer adoption quality that can be harder to systematically monitor without the broader sensing that large sales organizations sometimes provide [[12]](#post-12) [[14]](#post-14) [[53]](#post-53) [[52]](#post-52) [[27]](#post-27) [[2]](#post-2).

### **Frontline Adoption, Trust, and AI Safety in Healthcare and Defense ↔ Product-Led Growth Without a Large Salesforce: Feedback and Integration Risks**

Fast deployments and “bootcamp‑to‑deal” motions accelerate wins but risk embedding technical debt if frontline training and oversight lag; while embedded engineers can co‑develop high‑utility workflows, gaps in systematic feedback escalation remain a cited risk in complex environments, making structured field‑issue capture critical to sustaining value [[12]](#post-12) [[22]](#post-22) [[47]](#post-47) [[34]](#post-34).

### **Frontline Adoption, Trust, and AI Safety in Healthcare and Defense ↔ Cash, Free Cash Flow, and Optionality for R&D, M&A, and Buybacks**

Despite strong cash generation and stated reinvestment in AIP and technical hiring, Palantir has not published regular external audits of algorithmic bias/performance in healthcare or defense—indicating that, while the balance sheet supports continued capability build‑out, independent validation remains a missing piece in high‑stakes domains [[14]](#post-14) [[42]](#post-42) [[59]](#post-59) [[43]](#post-43).

### **Frontline Adoption, Trust, and AI Safety in Healthcare and Defense ↔ TCV Headlines vs. Revenue Recognition: Accounting Transparency and Contract Durability**

Large TCV wins often hinge on rapid, high‑ambition rollouts; yet the lack of longitudinal evidence showing workflow accuracy/value sustained beyond 18 months introduces durability questions that matter for revenue recognition over multi‑year contract spans with potential contingencies [[12]](#post-12) [[56]](#post-56) [[51]](#post-51) [[27]](#post-27).

## Quality of Hypergrowth: Rule of 40, Mix Shift, and Customer Diversification

Palantir’s Q2 2025 hypergrowth is unusual for its scale—48% year-over-year revenue growth alongside a 46% adjusted operating margin, yielding a Rule of 40 score of 94—raising the question of growth quality versus cyclic momentum. The mix shift is pronounced: U.S. drove 73% of revenue with U.S. commercial up 93% year over year, while international commercial declined 3% year over year. Customer count rose 43% year over year to 849, and large-deal velocity was high (157 deals ≥$1M; 42 ≥$10M), supporting visibility but also elevating scrutiny on concentration and durability. [[14]](#post-14) [[12]](#post-12)

The core debate is whether accelerating U.S. commercial adoption and a broader contract base constitute real diversification that can sustain high growth without outsized exposure to U.S. macro, policy, and public-sector cycles. Bulls point to expanding customer breadth and multi-year constructs as buffers against revenue cliffs. Skeptics emphasize the rising U.S. concentration and dependence on large U.S. government and platform contracts, arguing that diversification remains incomplete and could be tested if appropriations or AI budgets slow. [[14]](#post-14) [[48]](#post-48) [[24]](#post-24) [[23]](#post-23)

### Supporting Voices

> Palantir’s accelerating customer count (43% YoY, 10% q/q) and expanding contract base (157 $1M+ deals; 42 $10M+ deals in Q2) create stronger forward visibility, reducing abrupt revenue cliff risk—even if a few large government contracts lapse. — Buy-Side Portfolio Manager; Support: 6 [[48]](#post-48)

> Palantir’s 73% U.S.-revenue concentration increases vulnerability to future shifts in U.S. defense and tech policy because overexposure to a single jurisdiction (especially one with volatile political cycles) can constrain resilience against global shocks. — Global Operations Strategist; Support: 6 [[24]](#post-24)

> Much of Palantir’s hyper-growth narrative and 48–93% segment growth hinges on the durability of large government and US platform contracts, raising concentration risk if public sector demand or AI budgets slow. — Independent Short-Seller Researcher; Support: 5 [[23]](#post-23)

> Palantir’s Q2 Rule of 40 score of 94 is sector-leading among US-listed enterprise software firms with >$3B annualized run-rate, indicating exceptional simultaneous growth and profitability—typically a tradeoff at scale. — Institutional Tech Analyst; Support: 2 [[20]](#post-20)

### Minority / Dissent

> Palantir’s recurring revenue base is increasingly diversified across large-scale, multi-year contracts (e.g., Army 10-year, Maven), supporting long-term cash flow visibility and enabling aggressive R&D reinvestment without jeopardizing FCF quality—a flywheel few hypergrowth SaaS peers match. — Buy-Side Portfolio Manager; Support: 4 [[45]](#post-45)

### Analysis

Consensus acknowledges exceptional growth quality (Rule of 40 94) alongside clear concentration risks from a U.S.-heavy mix and reliance on large U.S. contracts. The divergence is about magnitude and mitigation: bulls cite expanding customer counts and multi-year constructs as effective buffers, while skeptics stress that international commercial contraction and policy-driven exposure could still pressure sustainability. Key uncertainties include the pace of non-U.S. recovery, proof of diversified growth beyond the public sector, and whether the broader contract base materially dampens downside if major U.S. contracts slow. Watch for sustained ex-government growth, a declining U.S. revenue mix, and stability in sequential revenue even amid contract churn.

## Ontology-Driven AIP as Moat: Frontline Learning Loops and Embedded Engineering

Palantir positions its ontology-centric AIP as the core differentiator that turns general-purpose LLMs into production-grade systems. Management asserts that enterprises are now “building their software on” AIP, replatforming onto its opinionated building blocks to compress time-to-value versus generic hyperscaler stacks, and that frontline workers are seeing tangible productivity gains as AI-enabled workflows move into daily operations [[13]](#post-13) [[12]](#post-12). This framing elevates AIP from an application to a platform layer and suggests a moat grounded in data/ontology integration plus workflow orchestration.

Operationally, Palantir’s embedded engineering model and co-development with end users are credited with accelerating “frontline learning loops,” where worker insights and live data are repeatedly embedded into workflows to improve resilience against drift and process change. Proponents argue this human-in-the-loop design compounds value over time; critics warn that the same speed and embedded posture can mask feedback bottlenecks and lifecycle decay if continuous retraining and validation lag [[38]](#post-38) [[47]](#post-47) [[26]](#post-26) [[51]](#post-51) [[34]](#post-34).

### Supporting Voices

> “Palantir’s embedded engineering approach, while presenting some feedback risks, enables rapid co-development of field-specific features with frontline workers, leading to bespoke, high-utility workflows that standard direct-sales software models rarely deliver at speed.” — Frontline Solutions Architect; Support: 6 [[47]](#post-47)

> “Palantir’s AIP/ontology-centric platform strategy accelerates cumulative ‘frontline learning loops’—each cycle of operational adaptation embeds both tacit worker insight and live data into production workflows, compounding resilience against model drift and unforeseen process change.” — Industrial Data Scientist; Support: 3 [[38]](#post-38)

> “Palantir’s focus on enabling frontline workers (e.g., discharge nurses, factory technicians) to not just use but build and adapt AI/ontology-embedded workflows can create rapid, cumulative productivity cycles—organizational learning compounds as human-machine systems co-evolve.” — Institutional Tech Analyst; Support: 3 [[26]](#post-26)

### Minority / Dissent

> “The claim that Palantir’s ontology-embedded systems ‘accelerate value realization’ may understate lifecycle decay: without persistent retraining and human validation, spectrum drift (i.e., process, sensor, or workforce evolution) can degrade AI-assisted workflows over time because initial frontline adaptation does not guarantee ongoing alignment.” — AI Security Regulator; Support: 6 [[51]](#post-51)

> “Palantir’s minimal direct salesforce approach can delay feedback loops from frontline users during complex integrations, as embedded engineers may not capture or relay all usability obstacles, increasing the risk of unnoticed adoption frictions in customer operations.” — Independent Short-Seller Researcher; Support: 4 [[34]](#post-34)

### Analysis
The dominant view holds that AIP’s ontology-driven architecture, combined with embedded engineering, creates compounding learning loops and faster time-to-value that constitute a defensible moat [[13]](#post-13) [[38]](#post-38) [[47]](#post-47). Dissent centers on durability: whether continuous retraining and systematic feedback capture are sufficient to prevent drift-driven decay and usability gaps as deployments scale and evolve [[51]](#post-51) [[34]](#post-34). The key uncertainties for investors are longitudinal evidence of sustained workflow accuracy and user-led adaptations, the robustness of mechanisms that escalate field issues into product changes, and how well the embedded model scales across diverse, complex environments [[13]](#post-13) [[38]](#post-38) [[47]](#post-47) [[51]](#post-51) [[34]](#post-34).

## U.S. Government Concentration and Geopolitical Exposure

Palantir’s growth engine is tightly coupled to the United States: Q2 revenue was 73% U.S.-sourced, buoyed by a 53% YoY surge in U.S. government and a 93% YoY spike in U.S. commercial; international commercial declined 3% YoY, underscoring the mix skew and diversification challenge [[12]](#post-12) [[14]](#post-14). The company also cited large U.S. government agreements (e.g., a 10‑year Army enterprise deal up to $10B and increased Maven smart system ceilings) that deepen alignment with U.S. defense priorities [[12]](#post-12). U.S. government revenue was $426M in Q2 (42% of total), highlighting the significance of appropriations and contract mechanics to near‑term results [[30]](#post-30).

This concentration is a double-edged sword. It reinforces momentum and validates Palantir’s positioning with U.S. institutions, but it elevates exposure to U.S. political cycles, regulatory shifts, and sovereignty‑driven pushback that can complicate cross‑border expansion—especially amid assertive U.S.-centric branding and values statements from leadership [[15]](#post-15) [[36]](#post-36) [[49]](#post-49).

### Supporting Voices

> Palantir’s 73% U.S.-revenue concentration increases vulnerability to future shifts in U.S. defense and tech policy because overexposure to a single jurisdiction (especially one with volatile political cycles) can constrain resilience against global shocks. — Global Operations Strategist; Support: 6 [[24]](#post-24)

> Much of Palantir’s hyper-growth narrative and 48–93% segment growth hinges on the durability of large government and US platform contracts, raising concentration risk if public sector demand or AI budgets slow. — Independent Short-Seller Researcher; Support: 5 [[23]](#post-23)

> Palantir’s heavy strategic alignment with U.S. national interests and defense ecosystem heightens long-term geopolitical backlash risk, because critical foreign markets (e.g., EU, Middle East, ASEAN) may restrict adoption to safeguard sovereignty or avoid perceived entanglement. — Global Operations Strategist; Support: 4 [[36]](#post-36)

> Escalating U.S. identity and defense branding (e.g., “revolution in the United States,” “unfair advantage”) could incentivize foreign regulators/policymakers to erect informal trade barriers or scrutinize deals, because overt strategic signaling triggers sovereignty defense reflexes. — Global Operations Strategist; Support: 5 [[49]](#post-49)

### Minority / Dissent

> Palantir’s accelerating customer count (43% YoY, 10% q/q) and expanding contract base (157 $1M+ deals; 42 $10M+ deals in Q2) create stronger forward visibility, reducing abrupt revenue cliff risk—even if a few large government contracts lapse. — Buy-Side Portfolio Manager; Support: 6 [[48]](#post-48)

### Analysis
Consensus emphasizes the upside–risk trade-off of U.S. concentration: it accelerates adoption and validates the model but heightens sensitivity to appropriations, regulatory shifts, and sovereignty backlash abroad. The minority view argues that a widening large‑deal base and multi‑year constructs buffer cliff risk. Key uncertainties: the pace of non‑U.S. growth sufficient to rebalance mix (e.g., sustained >10% revenue from ≥2 non‑U.S. blocs), whether ex‑government growth persists through policy cycles, and how prominently U.S. identity signaling affects cross-border approvals. Investors should monitor sustained non‑U.S. revenue share gains, sequential growth excluding government, and any emerging political friction in foreign deal flow [[14]](#post-14) [[36]](#post-36) [[23]](#post-23) [[48]](#post-48) [[45]](#post-45) [[49]](#post-49).

## TCV Headlines vs. Revenue Recognition: Accounting Transparency and Contract Durability

Record TCV and ACV headlines mattered this quarter: Palantir booked $2.3B of TCV, up 140% year over year, alongside a surge in large deals, strengthening perceived forward visibility and supporting raised revenue guidance [[14]](#post-14). But investors cannot assume a linear conversion from bookings to recognized revenue or cash. Government contracting mechanics and ASC 606 policy choices introduce material uncertainty: RPO excludes obligations with initial terms under 12 months and obligations beyond termination‑for‑convenience clauses—both common in U.S. government deals—so RPO skews commercial and understates parts of the public‑sector pipeline [[14]](#post-14). The company does not disclose the share of TCV subject to early termination or performance contingencies, nor contract‑level audit trails tying recognition to satisfied performance obligations, limiting outside validation of revenue timing and durability [[44]](#post-44) [[53]](#post-53).

These disclosure gaps are not theoretical. Back‑loaded and contingent payment structures are prevalent in both government and enterprise agreements, which means rapid TCV growth can overstate near‑term cash realization. Termination‑for‑convenience provisions can also unspool multi‑year revenue expectations if program priorities or appropriations shift [[27]](#post-27) [[39]](#post-39). The net effect: headline bookings and large‑deal counts are necessary but insufficient to gauge growth quality without deeper visibility into revenue schedules, performance‑obligation satisfaction, and value‑at‑risk within the TCV base [[52]](#post-52) [[44]](#post-44) [[53]](#post-53).

### Supporting Voices

> Palantir’s lack of contract-level revenue and risk disclosure, especially regarding its largest $10M+ deals, enables the smoothing or acceleration of revenue recognition under ASC 606 through subjective “performance obligations,” which can mask overstatement risk in near-term reported results. — Independent Short-Seller Researcher; Support: 7 [[52]](#post-52)

> Heavy reliance on TCV/ACV headlines without breakdown obscures deferred revenue mechanics; rapid TCV growth can overstate near-term actual cash recognition because many government/commercial deals have back-loaded or contingent payment terms. — Independent Short-Seller Researcher; Support: 6 [[27]](#post-27)

> Palantir’s headline $2.3B TCV bookings and surge in $10M+ deals risks overstating sustainable revenue, because concentrated multi-year government/enterprise contracts commonly have large termination-for-convenience or performance contingency clauses that can unspool future recognized revenue. — Independent Short-Seller Researcher; Support: 2 [[39]](#post-39)

### Minority / Dissent

> Palantir’s recurring revenue base is increasingly diversified across large-scale, multi-year contracts (e.g., Army 10-year, Maven), supporting long-term cash flow visibility and enabling aggressive R&D reinvestment without jeopardizing FCF quality—a flywheel few hypergrowth SaaS peers match. — Buy-Side Portfolio Manager; Support: 4 [[45]](#post-45)

### Analysis
The dominant view questions the reliability of TCV as a proxy for near‑term revenue and cash, citing ASC 606 discretion, back‑loaded schedules, and termination‑for‑convenience risk; the dissent argues that a broader, multi‑year contract base mitigates cliff risk. The tension matters because valuation hinges on growth quality, not just scale. Key uncertainties are the undisclosed portion of TCV subject to termination/contingency, the absence of contract‑level recognition evidence, and how RPO exclusions distort visibility for government work. Further transparency—aggregate value‑at‑risk, revenue timing by cohort, and independent audit trails—would narrow this gap [[14]](#post-14) [[27]](#post-27) [[39]](#post-39) [[44]](#post-44) [[52]](#post-52) [[53]](#post-53).

## Frontline Adoption, Trust, and AI Safety in Healthcare and Defense

Palantir’s growth narrative leans on rapid frontline deployment in high‑stakes arenas like hospitals and defense units, where trust and safety are non‑negotiable. Management cites fast wins (e.g., “bootcamp to $88M deal in a month,” Nebraska Medicine throughput gains) and accelerating defense usage (Maven adoption doubling again) as proof of production impact and urgency [[12]](#post-12) [[13]](#post-13). However, multiple observers flag a structural trust gap: as of Q2 2025, Palantir has not published regular, third‑party audits of algorithmic bias/performance in healthcare or defense, despite operating in domains where opaque errors can have systemic consequences [[43]](#post-43) [[58]](#post-58) [[59]](#post-59).

The dominant concern is twofold. First, safety governance: accelerated deployments without independent audits risk propagating hidden biases across sensitive workflows, especially where regulatory oversight demands are rising [[33]](#post-33) [[50]](#post-50). Second, durability: without persistent retraining and human validation, model and process drift can erode workflow integrity over time; rapid onboarding may also accrue technical debt if frontline staff lack sufficient time and support, risking inconsistent adoption and downstream errors [[51]](#post-51) [[22]](#post-22). These tensions make independent validation, user‑override behavior, and longitudinal performance evidence central to assessing adoption depth and safety.

### Supporting Voices

> Palantir’s lack of public, external audits for AI bias and performance—especially in sectors like healthcare—creates a trust gap, because vulnerable users (patients, nurses) must rely on institutional assurances without independent validation or recourse. — User Trust Advocate; Support: 6 [[50]](#post-50)

> The claim that Palantir’s ontology-embedded systems “accelerate value realization” may understate lifecycle decay: without persistent retraining and human validation, spectrum drift (i.e., process, sensor, or workforce evolution) can degrade AI-assisted workflows over time because initial frontline adaptation does not guarantee ongoing alignment. — AI Security Regulator; Support: 6 [[51]](#post-51)

> Rapid onboarding and deployment timelines (e.g., “bootcamp to $88M deal in a month”) can create hidden technical debt if frontline staff lack adequate time or support to adapt workflows, potentially leading to inconsistent adoption or downstream errors. — Frontline Solutions Architect; Support: 3 [[22]](#post-22)

### Minority / Dissent

> Palantir’s embedded engineering approach, while presenting some feedback risks, enables rapid co-development of field-specific features with frontline workers, leading to bespoke, high-utility workflows that standard direct-sales software models rarely deliver at speed. — Frontline Solutions Architect; Support: 6 [[47]](#post-47)

> Palantir’s focus on enabling frontline workers (e.g., discharge nurses, factory technicians) to not just use but build and adapt AI/ontology-embedded workflows can create rapid, cumulative productivity cycles—organizational learning compounds as human-machine systems co-evolve. — Institutional Tech Analyst; Support: 3 [[26]](#post-26)

### Analysis
The core divergence is between a governance-first view that prioritizes independent audits and longitudinal validation to mitigate systemic risk, and a field-driven view that embedded engineering and user co‑development can deliver safe, high‑utility workflows quickly. This matters because defense usage is scaling (Maven adoption doubling) while healthcare deployments are cited as transformative—yet regular third‑party audits remain absent, keeping trust and accountability questions open [[13]](#post-13) [[43]](#post-43) [[59]](#post-59). Key uncertainties for investors: whether Palantir will publish independent bias/performance audits, evidence of sustained workflow accuracy beyond 18 months, consistent error‑free usage across rollout sites, and documented user‑override behavior in practice [[51]](#post-51) [[22]](#post-22) [[50]](#post-50).

## Product-Led Growth Without a Large Salesforce: Feedback and Integration Risks

Palantir has long rejected a large, traditional direct-sales model in favor of product-led expansion anchored by embedded engineers and customer advocacy. Management reiterated that current customers are the primary “sales force,” with credibility and production impact driving faster, deeper deployments; this quarter’s record deal velocity and bookings suggest that approach is scaling in practice [[2]](#post-2) [[12]](#post-12) [[14]](#post-14). The upside is speed and fit: co-developing with frontline users can compress time-to-value and catalyze enterprise-wide rollouts, as seen in rapid starts and expansions across U.S. commercial accounts [[12]](#post-12) [[14]](#post-14).

The trade-off is sensing and control. Without broad sales coverage, complex integrations risk slower discovery of usability frictions, and fast “bootcamp-to-deal” motions can accrue technical debt if training and change-management lag [[34]](#post-34) [[22]](#post-22). The core question for investors is whether Palantir’s embedded model can maintain its velocity while instituting systematic feedback capture and adoption safeguards at scale.

### Supporting Voices

> “Palantir’s embedded engineering approach, while presenting some feedback risks, enables rapid co-development of field-specific features with frontline workers, leading to bespoke, high-utility workflows that standard direct-sales software models rarely deliver at speed.” — Frontline Solutions Architect; Support: 6 [[47]](#post-47)

> “Palantir’s minimal direct salesforce approach can delay feedback loops from frontline users during complex integrations, as embedded engineers may not capture or relay all usability obstacles, increasing the risk of unnoticed adoption frictions in customer operations.” — Independent Short-Seller Researcher; Support: 4 [[34]](#post-34)

> “Palantir’s focus on enabling frontline workers (e.g., discharge nurses, factory technicians) to not just use but build and adapt AI/ontology-embedded workflows can create rapid, cumulative productivity cycles—organizational learning compounds as human-machine systems co-evolve.” — Institutional Tech Analyst; Support: 3 [[26]](#post-26)

### Minority / Dissent

> “Rapid onboarding and deployment timelines (e.g., ‘bootcamp to $88M deal in a month’) can create hidden technical debt if frontline staff lack adequate time or support to adapt workflows, potentially leading to inconsistent adoption or downstream errors.” — Frontline Solutions Architect; Support: 3 [[22]](#post-22)

### Analysis
There is broad agreement that Palantir’s product-led, embedded model can unlock superior speed-to-value versus traditional sales-heavy motions, but concerns persist about scaling the feedback and governance needed for complex, multi-site integrations. The divergence hinges on whether current field engineering and co-development practices sufficiently surface and resolve frontline frictions fast enough as deployments multiply. Key uncertainties: the rigor and timeliness of field-issue escalation into product, consistency of training/change-management across rapid rollouts, and evidence that accelerated starts maintain stable, error-free usage as scope expands [[2]](#post-2) [[12]](#post-12) [[14]](#post-14) [[34]](#post-34) [[22]](#post-22).

## Cash, Free Cash Flow, and Optionality for R&D, M&A, and Buybacks

Palantir’s balance sheet strength is now part of the investment thesis. With $6.0B in cash and short-term Treasuries, zero debt, and Q2 adjusted free cash flow of $569M (57% margin), the company has the capacity to keep funding aggressive AI R&D, pursue targeted M&A, and continue share repurchases while absorbing potential volatility from its U.S.-centric exposure and government-heavy mix [[42]](#post-42) [[14]](#post-14). Management also raised full-year adjusted free cash flow guidance to $1.8–$2.0B and ended Q2 with $899M remaining under its repurchase authorization, reinforcing optionality even as expenses ramp for technical hiring [[14]](#post-14).

Investors broadly view this cash/FCF profile as a buffer against policy and macro shocks and as fuel for moat-deepening investments. The key caveat is quality: headline bookings and revenue recognition mechanics (ASC 606, termination-for-convenience) can complicate straight-line assumptions from TCV to cash, which matters for assessing how durable Palantir’s cash flywheel is if growth decelerates or mix shifts.

### Supporting Voices

> “Palantir’s $6B in cash and short-term securities plus expanding free cash flow ($569M in Q2, 57% margin) position it for opportunistic M&A, major R&D bets, or share repurchases without funding risk if U.S. business slows.” [[35]](#post-35)  
— Buy-Side Portfolio Manager; Support: 5

> “Palantir’s recurring revenue base is increasingly diversified across large-scale, multi-year contracts (e.g., Army 10-year, Maven), supporting long-term cash flow visibility and enabling aggressive R&D reinvestment without jeopardizing FCF quality—a flywheel few hypergrowth SaaS peers match.” [[45]](#post-45)  
— Buy-Side Portfolio Manager; Support: 4

> “Palantir’s accelerating customer count (43% YoY, 10% q/q) and expanding contract base (157 $1M+ deals; 42 $10M+ deals in Q2) create stronger forward visibility, reducing abrupt revenue cliff risk—even if a few large government contracts lapse.” [[48]](#post-48)  
— Buy-Side Portfolio Manager; Support: 6

### Minority / Dissent

> “Palantir’s lack of contract-level revenue and risk disclosure, especially regarding its largest $10M+ deals, enables the smoothing or acceleration of revenue recognition under ASC 606 through subjective ‘performance obligations,’ which can mask overstatement risk in near-term reported results.” [[52]](#post-52)  
— Independent Short-Seller Researcher; Support: 7

> “Heavy reliance on TCV/ACV headlines without breakdown obscures deferred revenue mechanics; rapid TCV growth can overstate near-term actual cash recognition because many government/commercial deals have back-loaded or contingent payment terms.” [[27]](#post-27)  
— Independent Short-Seller Researcher; Support: 6

### Analysis
The dominant view is that Palantir’s cash and FCF provide meaningful strategic optionality and resilience; dissent focuses on the quality and timing of cash conversion given ASC 606 discretion and government contract clauses. This divergence matters because valuation increasingly rests on sustained, high-quality cash generation to fund moat expansion. Key uncertainties: the degree to which multi-year contracts translate into predictable cash under varying appropriations cycles, how much of booked TCV is effectively at-risk, and whether disclosure will improve enough to reconcile bookings with cash realization over time [[14]](#post-14) [[45]](#post-45) [[52]](#post-52) [[27]](#post-27).

## Emerging Clusters & Factions

Five distinct clusters emerged. A bullish platform-economics group centers the debate on AIP/ontology scale advantages and exceptional Rule of 40 performance, while three skeptic axes probe resilience: (a) U.S.-mix/geopolitical exposure, (b) bookings-to-revenue transparency, and (c) trust/safety governance in high‑stakes domains. A fifth, implementation‑pragmatist cluster bridges optimism and caution on product‑led deployment dynamics.

### **Cluster 1: Platform-Economics Bulls**

- Hypergrowth quality is real: Rule of 40 at 94 alongside 48% YoY growth and 46% adjusted operating margin signals rare scale economics; raised FY25 guidance and a first-ever $1B quarter validate operating leverage and demand velocity. [[20]](#post-20) [[28]](#post-28) [[12]](#post-12) [[14]](#post-14)
- Moat comes from AIP/ontology plus embedded engineering that composes “frontline learning loops,” speeding time‑to‑value and compounding workflow utility; broadening customer base and strong cash/FCF enhance resilience and reinvestment capacity. [[13]](#post-13) [[38]](#post-38) [[47]](#post-47) [[26]](#post-26) [[48]](#post-48) [[35]](#post-35) [[42]](#post-42)
- Key voices: Institutional Tech Analyst, Buy-Side Portfolio Manager, Industrial Data Scientist

### **Cluster 2: U.S.-Concentration Realists**

- Rising U.S. exposure (≈73% of revenue) heightens sensitivity to appropriations and regulatory shifts; concentration in U.S. government and platform-scale awards is a structural risk factor. [[29]](#post-29) [[24]](#post-24) [[21]](#post-21) [[14]](#post-14)
- Assertive U.S.-centric branding may provoke sovereignty pushback and informal barriers abroad; international commercial softness underscores diversification challenges. [[49]](#post-49) [[36]](#post-36) [[14]](#post-14)
- Key voices: Global Operations Strategist, AI Security Regulator

### **Cluster 3: Accounting & Disclosure Skeptics**

- TCV optics can overstate near‑term revenue/cash due to back‑loaded schedules and termination‑for‑convenience; share of bookings at risk is undisclosed. [[27]](#post-27) [[39]](#post-39) [[44]](#post-44)
- Absent contract‑level ASC 606 audit trails and RPO exclusions for common government terms obscure recognition timing and performance‑obligation satisfaction on $10M+ deals. [[53]](#post-53) [[54]](#post-54) [[14]](#post-14) [[52]](#post-52)
- Key voices: Independent Short-Seller Researcher

### **Cluster 4: Trust, Safety, and Governance Advocates**

- No regular, third‑party audits of algorithmic bias/performance in healthcare or defense; this trust gap is material in high‑stakes settings. [[43]](#post-43) [[58]](#post-58) [[59]](#post-59) [[50]](#post-50)
- Rapid rollouts can create technical debt and lifecycle decay; lack of longitudinal (≥18 months) evidence on sustained accuracy/value elevates oversight and retraining needs. [[22]](#post-22) [[51]](#post-51) [[56]](#post-56) [[33]](#post-33) [[46]](#post-46)
- Key voices: AI Security Regulator, User Trust Advocate, Frontline Solutions Architect

### **Cluster 5: Implementation Pragmatists (Product-Led Execution)**

- Embedded engineering and co‑development with frontline users deliver bespoke, high‑utility workflows and faster time‑to‑value; empowering users to build workflows is a key accelerant. [[47]](#post-47) [[26]](#post-26) [[13]](#post-13)
- Minimal traditional salesforce risks slower feedback capture and uneven change‑management at scale; bootcamp‑to‑deal speed must be matched with robust training and escalation pathways. [[34]](#post-34) [[22]](#post-22) [[2]](#post-2)

### **Analysis**

#### **Convergences**
- Broad acknowledgment of a record quarter: first $1B revenue, strong U.S. momentum, and record TCV/large‑deal velocity. [[12]](#post-12) [[14]](#post-14)
- Shared recognition that U.S. mix is materially high and thus a central variable for resilience. [[29]](#post-29) [[24]](#post-24) [[14]](#post-14)
- Several clusters emphasize incomplete granularity in bookings‑to‑revenue mechanics (e.g., termination‑for‑convenience exposure, lack of contract‑level recognition trails). [[44]](#post-44) [[53]](#post-53) [[52]](#post-52)
- General acceptance that embedded engineering/product‑led motions are distinctive to Palantir’s go‑to‑market. [[47]](#post-47) [[2]](#post-2)

#### **Fault-Lines**
- Durability vs. cyclicality: Bulls see Rule of 40 performance as evidence of a platform moat; skeptics argue exposure to U.S. public‑sector cycles and platform contracts could test sustainability. [[20]](#post-20) [[23]](#post-23) [[21]](#post-21)
- Safety proof vs. speed: Platform advocates cite ontology‑driven learning loops; governance voices insist independent audits and 18+ month performance evidence are prerequisites in sensitive domains. [[38]](#post-38) [[26]](#post-26) [[51]](#post-51) [[33]](#post-33) [[46]](#post-46) [[56]](#post-56)
- Bookings quality: Portfolio‑strength arguments lean on multi‑year constructs and a broader customer base; accounting skeptics highlight termination risk and absent contract‑level ASC 606 ties. [[45]](#post-45) [[48]](#post-48) [[27]](#post-27) [[39]](#post-39) [[52]](#post-52) [[53]](#post-53)
- Identity strategy: Leadership’s overt U.S. orientation is viewed as a domestic accelerant by bulls, but as a potential brake on international growth by geopolitical risk watchers. [[15]](#post-15) [[49]](#post-49) [[36]](#post-36) [[14]](#post-14)

## Recommendations

Widely Supported
* Underwrite position sizing and valuation to U.S. concentration risk — track U.S. share (73% of revenue), sequential ex‑government growth, and signs of sustained diversification; use ≥5% q/q growth ex‑government for 4+ quarters as a falsifier of “public‑sector dependence” concerns [[14]](#post-14) [[21]](#post-21) [[23]](#post-23) [[24]](#post-24).
* Haircut TCV when modeling revenue/cash — assume back‑loaded schedules and termination‑for‑convenience risk; prioritize recognized revenue, cash from operations/FCF, remaining deal value, and RPO (with its government exclusions) over headline bookings until the company discloses aggregate value‑at‑risk and contract‑level ASC 606 links [[14]](#post-14) [[27]](#post-27) [[39]](#post-39) [[44]](#post-44) [[52]](#post-52) [[53]](#post-53).
* Use Rule of 40 and margin guidance as a durability screen — treat the 94 Rule of 40 and 46% adjusted operating margin as high-water marks; monitor whether Q3’s guided step‑up (>8% q/q revenue) and full‑year Rule of 40 of 91% hold as expenses ramp from hiring seasonality; any slippage warrants reassessing premium multiples [[14]](#post-14) [[20]](#post-20).
* Anchor U.S. commercial momentum checks on disclosed cohort signals — monitor U.S. commercial revenue growth (93% YoY), customer count expansion to 485 (+64% YoY), and U.S. commercial TCV/remaining deal value acceleration as leading indicators of sustained adoption depth [[14]](#post-14).
* Apply a governance/safety risk premium to healthcare and defense exposure — absence of regular third‑party audits of algorithmic bias/performance implies oversight gaps; treat any future independent audits as catalysts to tighten the discount [[43]](#post-43) [[58]](#post-58) [[59]](#post-59) [[50]](#post-50) [[33]](#post-33) [[46]](#post-46).
* Model geopolitical headwinds explicitly — international commercial declined 3% YoY; keep a jurisdictional discount until evidence of substantial, sustained (>10% revenue) growth emerges in ≥2 non‑U.S. blocs; watch for political friction tied to overt U.S. alignment [[14]](#post-14) [[36]](#post-36) [[49]](#post-49).
* Adjust channel checks to frontline reality — validate adoption beyond executive sponsorship by interviewing end users and supervisors, probing training depth, override behavior, and error handling; this mitigates risks from rapid “bootcamp‑to‑deal” motions and a minimal direct salesforce [[22]](#post-22) [[34]](#post-34) [[37]](#post-37) [[47]](#post-47).
* Include “cliff risk” scenarios in models — while no >20% sequential revenue drop post major contract loss is disclosed, use stress tests for large‑contract attrition to gauge revenue resilience and cash coverage under appropriations or priority shifts [[60]](#post-60).
* Reflect balance sheet and FCF in downside cases — $6B cash and a 57% adjusted FCF margin provide shock absorbers for R&D, M&A, and buybacks; give credit for optionality while keeping TCV‑to‑cash conversion conservative [[42]](#post-42) [[14]](#post-14) [[35]](#post-35).

Experimental / Watch-list
* Treat early AI workflow gains as front‑loaded until proven durable — watch for customer evidence of sustained workflow accuracy/value >18 months post‑deployment; in the interim, apply a decay factor in long‑dated cash‑flow assumptions [[51]](#post-51) [[56]](#post-56).
* Monitor for independent audit disclosures — any regulator‑verified or third‑party bias/performance audits in healthcare/defense should be viewed as de‑risking catalysts; absence sustains governance discounts [[43]](#post-43) [[58]](#post-58) [[59]](#post-59) [[46]](#post-46) [[50]](#post-50).
* Track cross‑border deal flow quality — use >$10M international contracts with minimal political/regulatory friction as indicators to ease sovereignty‑risk haircuts; catalog any such wins over time [[57]](#post-57) [[36]](#post-36) [[49]](#post-49).
* Validate “bootcamp‑to‑deal” deployments with usage telemetry — seek evidence of stable, error‑free usage across rollout sites before extrapolating TCV to lifetime value; treat lack of site‑level metrics as grounds for conservative LTV assumptions [[12]](#post-12) [[22]](#post-22).
* Test AIP replatforming moat via expansion kinetics — watch net dollar retention (128%) and top‑20 TTM revenue per customer (+30% YoY to $75M) alongside disclosures that customers are “building on AIP”; sustained patterns support a higher moat rating [[13]](#post-13) [[14]](#post-14).
* Watch feedback-loop robustness in a product‑led model — look for disclosures or diligence signals on escalation speed from field issues to product changes; scale without a broad salesforce may introduce blind spots that affect satisfaction and renewals [[34]](#post-34) [[2]](#post-2).
* Observe international commercial re‑acceleration — use a turn from −3% YoY to sustained positive growth and improving q/q as a trigger to reduce U.S. concentration discounts; absent improvement, keep jurisdictional risk elevated [[14]](#post-14).
* Cross‑check government program durability with usage and ceilings — increased Maven ceiling and repeated usage doubling, plus the Army 10‑year enterprise agreement, are supportive; still incorporate appropriation/priority risk until more granular recognition and termination exposure are disclosed [[12]](#post-12) [[13]](#post-13) [[44]](#post-44).

## Expert Network Questions

### **Profile 1 – ASC 606 Revenue Recognition Auditor (TCV-to-revenue conversion and contract risk)**
* How would you map Palantir’s typical performance obligations (e.g., hosted software, services, customization) to ASC 606 recognition methods, and which ones most enable discretion in timing?
* For multi‑year government and enterprise deals with termination-for-convenience, how should revenue timing be constrained by variable consideration guidance and probability of reversal?
* What contract artifacts (e.g., delivery order schedules, acceptance criteria, milestone definitions) are most probative for linking $10M+ deals to satisfied performance obligations?
* RPO excludes obligations beyond termination clauses and <12‑month terms; what alternative disclosures (contract assets, billings cadence, remaining deal value cohorts) best triangulate back‑loaded schedules?
* Which balance sheet patterns flag potential smoothing (rapid growth in contract assets vs deferred revenue, unusual changes in significant financing components), and how would you test them?
* How would you haircut TCV for modeling—by clause prevalence (termination, contingencies), by customer cohort hazard rates, or by sector (government vs commercial)—and what sensitivity bands would you apply?
* What would you ask management to disclose (aggregated value‑at‑risk, revenue timing buckets by cohort, renewal/termination rates) to validate bookings quality without revealing competitive details?
* How do short‑term (<12 months) arrangements typically flow through revenue without appearing in RPO, and what forensic steps help estimate their contribution and renewal risk?
* For “top‑20 customers averaging $75M TTM,” which audit procedures would tie recognized revenue back to obligations delivered, especially where expansions overlap prior SOWs?
* How do you reconcile record TCV with cash conversion—what metrics (billings mix, days sales outstanding, growth in unbilled receivables) best predict near‑term FCF?

### **Profile 2 – Former DoD Contracting/Program Executive (appropriations, enterprise agreements, termination risk)**
* The 10‑year Army enterprise vehicle consolidates ~75 contracts: what contract structure is most likely (e.g., IDIQ with delivery orders), and how does that influence funding predictability vs termination flexibility?
* How often are termination‑for‑convenience or partial de‑scopes exercised in software/AI programs, and what leading indicators (e.g., obligation slowdowns, deobligations) precede them?
* With a raised ceiling on Maven, what is the practical path from ceiling to obligations to revenue recognition—what operational usage or readiness metrics historically correlate with obligation velocity?
* During continuing resolutions or election transitions, how are AI/software sustainment and expansion orders prioritized relative to new starts, and which order types are most resilient?
* What performance metrics and acceptance gates are typically embedded in large enterprise agreements, and how do they concentrate performance risk across consolidated workstreams?
* Which public data sources (USAspending, FPDS, budget justifications) offer the most reliable early read on delivery order flow, obligation pace, and potential program re‑scopes?
* How do IL6 and FedRAMP High accreditations affect Authority to Operate timelines and awardability in classified and sensitive unclassified environments—do they materially reduce execution risk?
* For enterprise rollouts across Army and joint users, where do integration bottlenecks usually emerge (ATO renewals, data access, enclave boundaries), and how might they impact recognition timing?
* What governance bodies (e.g., PEOs, CDAO) most influence AI fielding milestones, and what meeting or milestone cadence should investors monitor for inflection signals?
* In allied or FMS contexts, how might overt U.S.-centric positioning affect procurement acceptance, and what mitigations (data sovereignty, hosting posture) are most effective?

### **Profile 3 – Clinical AI Safety & Hospital Informatics Leader (auditability, adoption durability, governance)**
* What constitutes a credible third‑party clinical audit for AI used in hospital operations (scope, sample sizes, bias/performance metrics, re‑audit cadence), and how should results be reported to stakeholders?
* For “bootcamp‑to‑deal” implementations, what minimum training, shadow‑mode duration, and phased rollout criteria reduce technical debt and patient‑safety risks?
* Which telemetry best reflects deep adoption quality in clinical settings (override rates, near‑miss capture, alert fatigue trends, time‑to‑task completion, adherence to recommended pathways)?
* How would you design an 18‑ to 24‑month longitudinal study to evidence sustained value (throughput, LOS, readmissions, safety events) and guard against survivorship bias?
* What early signals indicate ontology or data pipeline drift in hospital workflows, and what automated guardrails (pre‑deployment tests, drift thresholds, rollback protocols) are essential?
* Which UX patterns most effectively increase clinician trust (explanations, provenance tracing, uncertainty display) without overloading frontline staff?
* Who should own model validation and change control in hospitals (CMIO, QA committees, risk management), and what cadence of post‑deployment reviews is appropriate?
* What artifacts would you request from a vendor to verify operational maturity (ontology change logs, branch histories, incident post‑mortems, closed‑loop error handling metrics)?
* How should incident response and adverse event traceability be structured contractually (SLA metrics, escalation windows, root‑cause timelines, remediation obligations)?
* What outcome‑based pricing or safety‑linked SLAs align vendor incentives with durable, bias‑aware performance over the contract life?

## Materiality & Impact Assessment

### **Theme 1 — Quality of Hypergrowth: Rule of 40, Mix Shift, and Customer Diversification**

#### **Scale**
- Financial impact is material: first-ever $1.0B quarterly revenue, 48% YoY growth, 46% adjusted operating margin, and Rule of 40 of 94. Management raised FY25 revenue guidance to $4.142–$4.150B and guided Q3 to ~8%+ q/q growth, indicating near-term operating torque [[14]](#post-14) [[12]](#post-12) [[20]](#post-20).
- Customer diversification is improving: total customers reached 849 (+43% YoY, +10% q/q); top-20 TTM revenue per customer rose to $75M (+30% YoY). Large-deal velocity (157 ≥$1M; 42 ≥$10M) strengthens perceived visibility [[14]](#post-14) [[48]](#post-48).
- Mix shift toward U.S. commercial is pronounced and strategically relevant: U.S. commercial revenue grew 93% YoY; U.S. revenue is 73% of total [[12]](#post-12) [[14]](#post-14).

#### **Timing**
- Immediate: acceleration already evident in Q2 and embedded in Q3 and FY25 guidance [[14]](#post-14).
- Near- to mid‑term (2025): guidance implies sustained high growth and margins through year-end [[14]](#post-14).

#### **Dependencies**
- Continued U.S. commercial adoption and expansion at pace (93% YoY in Q2) [[14]](#post-14).
- Conversion of record large-deal activity (157 ≥$1M; 42 ≥$10M) into recognized revenue without delays [[14]](#post-14).
- Maintaining high margins while ramping technical hiring and product investment [[14]](#post-14).
- Avoiding revenue cliffs despite government/large-contract exposure; expanding the broader customer base to cushion churn [[48]](#post-48) [[14]](#post-14).

#### **Net Impact**
- Positive but sensitive to concentration and execution. Strength of growth and profitability is clear; however, dependence on U.S. mix and large agreements introduces asymmetry if public‑sector demand slows or if international re-acceleration lags [[24]](#post-24) [[23]](#post-23) [[14]](#post-14).


### **Theme 2 — Ontology-Driven AIP as Moat: Frontline Learning Loops and Embedded Engineering**

#### **Scale**
- Strategic differentiation: management positions AIP/ontology as the prerequisite to make LLMs useful in production; customers replatforming “on AIP” suggests platform-layer entrenchment [[13]](#post-13).
- Operational impact: cited examples include Citi and Fannie Mae accelerating critical workflows to “seconds,” Nebraska Medicine throughput gains, and industrial line-balancing compression “from one day to one hour” via Warp Speed components [[12]](#post-12) [[13]](#post-13).
- Defense validation: Maven usage “doubling again” since February, indicating expanding operational reliance [[13]](#post-13).

#### **Timing**
- Immediate: benefits already visible in Q2 case examples and usage metrics [[12]](#post-12) [[13]](#post-13).
- Ongoing: as LLMs improve, management expects AIP value to compound; AIFD is being built to automate ontology/app work with closed-loop error handling [[13]](#post-13).

#### **Dependencies**
- Enterprises continuing to build on AIP’s opinionated building blocks rather than generic hyperscaler stacks [[13]](#post-13).
- Sustained effectiveness of embedded engineering/co-development to translate frontline needs into durable workflows [[47]](#post-47).
- Guardrails against lifecycle decay and model/process drift over time [[51]](#post-51).
- Continued demonstrable production impact in flagship accounts to support replatforming narrative [[12]](#post-12).

#### **Net Impact**
- Likely positive with compounding potential, but contingent on durable performance and governance. Strength in production wins and usage growth is offset by risks of drift and the need for systematic validation over time [[38]](#post-38) [[51]](#post-51) [[13]](#post-13).


### **Theme 3 — U.S. Government Concentration and Geopolitical Exposure**

#### **Scale**
- Concentration is high: 73% of revenue from the U.S.; U.S. government revenue of $426M (42% of total) grew 53% YoY; large U.S. government awards (e.g., Army up to $10B; Maven ceiling increase) intensify U.S. alignment [[12]](#post-12) [[14]](#post-14) [[30]](#post-30).
- International commercial softness: −3% YoY in Q2 underlines diversification challenge [[14]](#post-14).
- Policy/geopolitical sensitivity: exposure to appropriations and potential sovereignty pushback is material [[21]](#post-21) [[24]](#post-24) [[36]](#post-36) [[49]](#post-49).

#### **Timing**
- Immediate: concentration is already shaping results; U.S. momentum is powering current growth [[12]](#post-12) [[14]](#post-14).
- Mid‑ to long‑term: geopolitical backlash or policy shifts could affect cross‑border adoption and renewal cycles [[36]](#post-36) [[49]](#post-49).

#### **Dependencies**
- Continued U.S. government and commercial demand at current growth rates (53% and 93% YoY, respectively) [[14]](#post-14).
- Stable appropriations and program priorities (e.g., Maven, Army enterprise) without de‑scope or termination [[12]](#post-12) [[21]](#post-21).
- Tangible non‑U.S. re-acceleration to dilute U.S. mix; reduction from 73% U.S. share over time [[14]](#post-14) [[24]](#post-24).
- Managing foreign sovereignty concerns amplified by overt U.S.-centric branding [[49]](#post-49).

#### **Net Impact**
- Ambiguous. Near-term upside from U.S. alignment is clear; medium-term resilience depends on diversifying away from single-jurisdiction exposure and navigating geopolitical sensitivities [[24]](#post-24) [[36]](#post-36) [[14]](#post-14).


### **Theme 4 — TCV Headlines vs. Revenue Recognition: Accounting Transparency and Contract Durability**

#### **Scale**
- Headline strength: $2.3B TCV in Q2 (record), with 42 deals ≥$10M and elevated remaining deal value/RPO growth; however, RPO excludes common government structures (e.g., <12‑month terms, beyond termination-for-convenience), limiting visibility [[14]](#post-14).
- Disclosure gaps: no disclosed proportion of TCV subject to early termination/performance contingencies; no contract-level ASC 606 audit trails tying recognition to obligations [[44]](#post-44) [[53]](#post-53).
- Modeling risk: TCV can overstate near-term revenue/cash due to back‑loaded or contingent schedules; termination-for-convenience clauses can unspool multi‑year expectations [[27]](#post-27) [[39]](#post-39).

#### **Timing**
- Immediate: affects current interpretation of Q2 bookings and FY25 guidance quality [[14]](#post-14).
- Ongoing: persists until greater disclosure on value-at-risk and revenue timing is provided [[44]](#post-44) [[53]](#post-53).

#### **Dependencies**
- Absence of early termination or de‑scope across major multi‑year contracts [[39]](#post-39).
- Recognition aligned to satisfied performance obligations without aggressive acceleration under ASC 606 [[52]](#post-52) [[53]](#post-53).
- Improved transparency on contract schedules, termination exposure, and revenue timing cohorts [[44]](#post-44) [[53]](#post-53).
- RPO interpretability given government exclusions; alternative metrics (remaining deal value, billings cadence) used consistently [[14]](#post-14).

#### **Net Impact**
- Ambiguous to negative for perceived durability until disclosure improves. Strong bookings uplift confidence, but recognition/cash conversion uncertainty is a material valuation constraint [[27]](#post-27) [[52]](#post-52) [[14]](#post-14).


### **Theme 5 — Frontline Adoption, Trust, and AI Safety in Healthcare and Defense**

#### **Scale**
- High-stakes domains: rapid “bootcamp to $88M TCV” in healthcare and rising Maven usage show operational reach, but absence of regular third‑party audits for bias/performance creates a trust and governance gap with systemic risk implications [[12]](#post-12) [[13]](#post-13) [[43]](#post-43) [[58]](#post-58) [[59]](#post-59).
- Durability risk: lack of longitudinal evidence (>18 months) on sustained accuracy/value and potential technical debt from fast rollouts could impact renewal quality and expansion velocity [[56]](#post-56) [[22]](#post-22) [[51]](#post-51).

#### **Timing**
- Immediate: deployments and usage are underway; audits remain absent as of Q2 2025 [[13]](#post-13) [[43]](#post-43) [[59]](#post-59).
- Mid‑term: governance expectations and evidence needs (audits, longitudinal data) will shape adoption depth and persistence [[51]](#post-51) [[56]](#post-56).

#### **Dependencies**
- Publication of independent bias/performance audits in healthcare/defense to close the trust gap [[43]](#post-43) [[58]](#post-58) [[59]](#post-59).
- Sufficient training/change-management to mitigate technical debt from accelerated timelines [[22]](#post-22).
- Evidence of sustained workflow accuracy/value beyond 18 months post‑deployment [[51]](#post-51) [[56]](#post-56).
- Demonstrated user‑override behavior and safe human‑in‑the‑loop practices in production [[37]](#post-37).

#### **Net Impact**
- Ambiguous with downside skew until independent validation emerges. Operational wins are meaningful, but governance gaps and durability uncertainties can constrain valuation multiples tied to healthcare and defense exposure [[33]](#post-33) [[50]](#post-50) [[56]](#post-56).


### **Theme 6 — Product-Led Growth Without a Large Salesforce: Feedback and Integration Risks**

#### **Scale**
- Go‑to‑market leverage: record deal counts and rapid expansions indicate product-led motion and customer advocacy are scaling; leadership reiterates minimal traditional salesforce reliance [[12]](#post-12) [[14]](#post-14) [[2]](#post-2).
- Execution risk: limited sales coverage can slow detection of usability frictions in complex integrations; rapid “bootcamp‑to‑deal” may embed technical debt if training lags [[34]](#post-34) [[22]](#post-22).

#### **Timing**
- Immediate: Q2 results reflect current model effectiveness [[12]](#post-12) [[14]](#post-14).
- Mid‑term: as deployments multiply, robustness of feedback escalation and change‑management will be tested [[34]](#post-34).

#### **Dependencies**
- Continued customer-led advocacy and willingness to scale deployments enterprise‑wide [[2]](#post-2) [[3]](#post-3).
- Adequate embedded engineering capacity and systematic issue escalation from field to product [[47]](#post-47) [[34]](#post-34).
- Structured training and phased rollouts to minimize adoption friction and errors [[22]](#post-22).
- Maintenance of credibility via demonstrated production impact across verticals [[12]](#post-12).

#### **Net Impact**
- Net positive with identifiable operational risks. The model is generating velocity and large deals; sustainability hinges on formalizing feedback loops and change‑management at scale [[47]](#post-47) [[34]](#post-34) [[22]](#post-22).


### **Theme 7 — Cash, Free Cash Flow, and Optionality for R&D, M&A, and Buybacks**

#### **Scale**
- Financial buffer and strategic firepower: $6.0B cash and short-term Treasuries, zero debt; Q2 adjusted FCF $569M (57% margin). Remaining $899M under repurchase authorization; raised FY25 adjusted FCF guidance to $1.8–$2.0B [[14]](#post-14) [[42]](#post-42).
- Supports continued AI R&D, selective M&A, and buybacks even amid potential U.S. concentration volatility [[35]](#post-35) [[14]](#post-14).

#### **Timing**
- Immediate: cash/FCF strength realized in Q2 and embedded in FY25 guidance [[14]](#post-14).
- Near‑term: optionality deployable through 2025 while expenses ramp for technical hiring [[14]](#post-14).

#### **Dependencies**
- Sustained high margins and cash conversion from multi‑year contracts [[14]](#post-14).
- Bookings converting to revenue and cash without significant termination or timing shocks [[27]](#post-27) [[39]](#post-39).
- Balance of capital allocation across R&D, M&A, and repurchases aligned with growth durability [[35]](#post-35) [[14]](#post-14).

#### **Net Impact**
- Positive. Strong cash generation and net cash provide resilience and investment capacity, partially offsetting concentration and recognition risks; caution warranted on TCV‑to‑cash timing [[35]](#post-35) [[27]](#post-27) [[14]](#post-14).

<a id="post-1"></a>
[1] **Anna Sorrow, Finance Team Member, Palantir Technologies** Full transcript - Palantir Technologies Inc (PLTR) Q2 2025: Anna Sorrow, Finance Team Member, Palantir Technologies: Afternoon. I’m Anna Sorrow from Palantir’s finance team, and I’d like to welcome you to our second quarter twenty twenty five earnings call. We’ll be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market closed and posted on our Investor Relations website. During the call, we will make statements regarding our business that may be considered forward looking within applicable securities laws, including statements regarding our third quarter and fiscal twenty twenty five results, management’s expectations for our future financial and operational performance, and other statements regarding our plans, prospects, and expectations. These statements are not promises or guarantees and are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from actual results. Information concerning those risks is available in our earnings press release distributed after the market closed today and in our SEC filings. We undertake no obligation to update forward looking statements except as required by law. Further, during the course of today’s call, we will refer to certain adjusted financial measures. These non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or in isolation from, GAAP measures. Additional information about these non GAAP measures, including reconciliation of non GAAP to comparable GAAP measures, is included in our press release and investor presentation provided today. Our press release, investor presentation, and other earnings materials are available on our Investor Relations website at investors.palantir.com. Over the course of the call, we will refer to various growth rates when discussing our business. These rates reflect year over year comparisons unless otherwise stated. Joining me on today’s call are Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer and Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer. I’ll now turn it over to Ryan to start the call.

<a id="post-2"></a>
[2] **Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer, Palantir Technologies** Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer, Palantir Technologies: Yeah. You know, for those of you who are new to Palantir, one of the many, many controversial we were doomed to failure decisions we made was that we rejected an idea of, like, basically the way software is often done, useless product that becomes parasitic, you can’t get rid of it, and you have 1,000 steak dinners all convinced you to buy something that’s useless, you can’t get rid of. And we believed that we would be always be downstream from the value we create, and it’s we would be able to capture that value. And if you look how this company is organized in government and commercial, it is all built around those ideas, including internal orchestration, including our fan hierarchy, including the products we deliver. Our primary sales force now and I think likely in the future are going to be current customers telling other customers, if you want this to work, bring them in and listen to how they orchestrate their culture inside your culture with their products. And it’s not that we won’t have direct salespeople, but we need what’s really helping us now is the increased credibility so that people use more of our product on day one so that they’re not using Foundry the Foundry product of three years ago. They’re really aspiring to what can be done with ontology and large language models and our FD structure. And and the the the disadvantage of this is, yeah, you don’t have 10,000 people roaming around selling something they don’t understand. But the advantage is we go from once we come in the door, we come in with enormous credibility. So the person we’re selling to believes we will make them a lot of money, save them expenses, or we will make their soldiers safer and more lethal. And they believe it because they’ve heard it from someone they trust and or in The US economy, there are a lot of people that go from one job to the next. So that somebody we meet in one place very likely will be somewhere else in a year or two. And the first call we get in fact, I was just doing a customer customer call, partner call. We’re very early with these people. The story was, hey. I got blocked at my last enterprise. They wouldn’t let me buy Foundry. I’ve been following Foundry and now Ontology. First call was to us. And that then when the meetings the meetings have shifted from, hey. We may not know how to use you to very much, tell us how we could create the kind of leverage you have. And and that that’s why these numbers are going up at the top end and at the bottom end because we’re coming in with a different kind of credibility and leverage. So our in the near future, the 10x revenue we are going to get in The U. S. Over the next, in my view, next five years. But certainly, what we forecasted for this year, it’s really people saying, wow. I mean, and then you have and then everyone talks about us on their earnings calls. So like when you see AIG or others saying, I believe I can dramatically change my business at a lower cost. You know, CEOs, CIOs, chief revenue officers, the whole group are like, get them on the phone. And this just makes our whole thing easier because we do not have time or interest in spending all the time we did in the past starting from complete ignorance. We’re starting from a much higher level. And then the higher level allows us to ratchet up. So that’s going to be what we’re going to do. Obviously, we’re going to continue. Samir and others and Cam have built a a very small, nimble Salesforce. We have people who’ve been here for a long time doing very large deals. We have Ryan who’s doing this organizing the contracts full time. But, I mean, I’ll let Ryan speak to this. The leverage we have in these calls, I don’t mean leverage just financial, the leverage to create the value that is upstream of what we get paid. We are very focused on the value creation and then collecting later.

<a id="post-3"></a>
[3] **Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer, Palantir Technologies** Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer, Palantir Technologies: Yeah. And what we’re seeing is, like, the the leadership of our customers are coming to us saying, how do we we’re seeing it start more quickly, expand more quickly, and expand deeper, and they’re coming to us now at the beginning saying, how do we roll this across the the whole enterprise? They’re willing

<a id="post-4"></a>
[4] **Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer, Palantir Technologies** Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer, Palantir Technologies: to be more experimental because, you know, we were at a big customer and it’s like, look, we’ll do this and this side of the contract. Why don’t you let us do the rest and we’ll just see the value? You know? See the value. We’ll discuss it later. The the yeah. And and then this is yet another advantage America has that we underestimate. It’s so plastic. If you compare America to, say, Germany, the the way in which they build industry, they purchase software, they judge software, they there’s a there’s a pattern that is etched in stone there. But in America, people are very open to value creation, and they’re under more pressure. And also, people inside the company have more upside in the company. They have more equity. They want things that work. They don’t want theory.

[5] **Anna Sorrow, Finance Team Member, Palantir Technologies** Anna Sorrow, Finance Team Member, Palantir Technologies: Thank you both. Our next question is from Mariana with Bank of America. Mariana, please turn on your camera, and then you’ll receive a prompt to unmute your line.

<a id="post-6"></a>
[6] **Mariana, Analyst, Bank of America** Mariana, Analyst, Bank of America: Good afternoon, everyone. Greetings. Mariana, Analyst, Bank of America: two questions. One, on the AI action plan that the White House put out a couple of weeks ago. You have been part of this process through recommendations. What excites you the most, and where do you think there is still work to do. And the second one is about talent because to make sure that you are part of the or the dominant software of the future, you have to make sure that you keep attracting, retaining, and training the right talent. And we are seeing this, I don’t know, battle over talent in software companies right now. How you make sure that you are ahead of everyone else and keep attracting the right people?

<a id="post-7"></a>
[7] **Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer, Palantir Technologies** Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer, Palantir Technologies: I have Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer, Palantir Technologies: On the first bit with the AI action plan, I I think it’s it’s incredibly exciting. Essentially, we’re taking all the breaks off. You you know, AI really is an empirical journey, and you have to roll up your sleeves and and actually focus on the implementation of it. It’s a clear recognition that having an American open AI tech stack that we all build our solutions on is absolutely crucial and important, and that perhaps we had been spending too much time hand wringing and not enough time doing things. So not not only Palantir, but I think the entire industry and the customers of the industry are really excited to get to work and to to realize the value that we can have by doing this and the support and the subsequent follow on investments that this implies. And and on the talent side, you know, I think the most important thing is giving people access to problems that matter. We we’ve seen our retention be quite strong. There’s there’s really no other place. So you think about the number of production workflows that we have around AI. There’s there’s a set of folks who like to just do research, who like to just think about what was possible. And but at this plate, we are able to attract and retain and motivate people who actually want to bend the arc of history here, work on the problems that drive outcomes.

<a id="post-8"></a>
[8] **Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer, Palantir Technologies** Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer, Palantir Technologies: This is what Shyam saying is so right. The if it well, the I mean, part of the value of doing these calls is, like, if you are a highly talented person and would believe that the West is superior or at least tolerant of me telling you it every day, you will not find a place anywhere I’ve seen. And now I’ve in over twenty years, I’ve interacted with almost every agency in the West, many of the largest companies, many of the smaller companies. You will not find a place that is comparable on time of joining to full agency like Palantir. We have this, and and by the way, we’re ratcheting this up, like more internal orchestration. You come here from from the time you come here to the time you’re working on something that literally will be in the paper, in the economic section, in the consumer section, or in the government section of the paper, it could be three months. There is nothing like that, a. And b, now that everyone knows this, this is by far the best credential in tech. If you come to Palantir, your career is set. And the the other thing I that is not exactly related that I really just love about that, if you did not go to school or you went to a school that’s not that great or you went to Harvard or Princeton Yale, Once you come to Palantir, you’re a Palantirian. No one cares about the other stuff. They don’t care what your parents did. They don’t care how rich your parents are. They don’t care where you went to school. They cared about they care about, were you at Palantir? How are you viewed at Palantir? What did you work on at Palantir? And so we are re credentialing making a new credential independent of class and background at Palantir that is the most important credential in tech. And that’s one of the two reasons, agency plus that, that we are we are doing very, very well on the on the on the talent acquisition and retention side.

<a id="post-9"></a>
[9] **Anna Sorrow, Finance Team Member, Palantir Technologies** Anna Sorrow, Finance Team Member, Palantir Technologies: Thank you both. Alex, as always, we have a lot of individual investors on the line. Is there anything you’d like to say before we end the call?

<a id="post-10"></a>
[10] **Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer, Palantir Technologies** Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer, Palantir Technologies: Maybe stop talking to all the haters. They’re they’re they’re suffering. You know, don’t tell them about how important the ride has been, how exciting it’s been, how much you’ve enjoyed the ride, how how much fun it is to send, to write little emails to analysts that spent twenty years learning about software and have been wrong about every quarter. Maybe just, you know, just don’t talk to them. There’s some suffering going on. But for the rest of us, we are enjoying this time, and and we’re enjoying it with you. And our performance and your support of it is is is both important because you deserve it and we are grateful that you gave it to us especially and I definitely have not forgotten. There would have been no DPO. We would not have gone from our low share price to now. We would not have many of the clients we have and we wouldn’t have some of the pride we have without you. But I would also say our ability to win while sticking by what we believe is important for the world because we live in a world where people are purveying half truths, partial truths. Palantir gets attacked just because we help make this country even better, because we support the values, because we defend it. And, you know, us being able to win while having an opinion does have an impact on the world, if only because the people who think we are wrong or not good have to be a little jealous and suffer. And you know what? That’s a good thing too. So I’m very, very proud of this quarter. And by the way, obviously, to all the Palantirians who made this happen, you know, behind the scenes, we are just, to use Shyam’s term, grinding, and every day and all the time on our most important things we’re working on. And, you know, we’ve had deployments here that because of their criticality, our people are working around the clock for half a month, around the clock on a cycle. And they’re really proud to do that, and they have changed the arc of history and your support inside the company and outside the company. And, also, we’re asking people to work in an environment when they come in here that is very different than anything they’ve ever worked on. You know, they they most of them come from university where they’ve just been engaged in platitudes. Now it’s frontline where things matter, and we do things very differently than anyone else. And the fact that Palantirians have aligned to do this, to work as a failings failings in the service of what I view as a higher purpose, and I think many agree with me, is an enormous accomplishment. And, you know, I especially I speak for all of us who, like, work with these people. This is a very special environment, and I’m super proud to somehow ended up being your leader. So thank you.

[11] **Anna Sorrow, Finance Team Member, Palantir Technologies** Anna Sorrow, Finance Team Member, Palantir Technologies: Thank you. That concludes Q and A for today’s call.

<a id="post-12"></a>
[12] **Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer, Palantir Technologies** Ryan Taylor, Chief Revenue Officer and Chief Legal Officer, Palantir Technologies: Our tremendous second quarter results demonstrate how Palantir is redefining what is possible with enterprise AI. We remain maniacally focused on value creation for our customers. Our U. S. Business is the engine of this transformation. U. S. Commercial led with 93% year over year revenue growth, outpacing our U. S. Government revenue growth of 53% year over year. Our overall U. S. Business revenue grew 68% year over year and 17% sequentially, and now represents 73% of total company revenue. We surpassed $1,000,000,000 in quarterly revenue for the first time, as our overall revenue growth continued to rapidly accelerate to 48% year over year growth in Q2. Through this record breaking quarter, our Rule of 40 score continued to climb, reaching 94 in Q2, which is up 11 points quarter over quarter, particularly noteworthy given the scale of our business. As AI continues to relentlessly advance, the market has become increasingly aware of the most important and fundamental technical reality. LLMs, on their own, are at best a jagged intelligence divorced from even basic understanding. In one moment, they may appear to outperform humans in some problem solving task, but in the next, they make catastrophic errors no human would ever make. By contrast, our ontology is pure understanding, concretized in software. This is reality, not rhetoric, And enterprises are experiencing this reality keenly. LLMs simply don’t work in the real world without Palantir. This is the reality fueling our growth. We booked our highest TCV and ACV ever last quarter, with $2,300,000,000 in TCV and $684,000,000 in ACV. We closed a whopping 157 deals worth $1,000,000 or more, of which 66 deals were worth $5,000,000 or more, and 42 deals were worth $10,000,000 or more. We continue to see expansions with our existing customers, as our top 20 customers now average $75,000,000 a year in trailing twelve month revenue, up 30% from a year ago. The impact our software is delivering for our customers as they cross the chasm is ever widening their advantage over the AI have nots. Citibank shared that the customer onboarding process and relevant KYC and security checks that once took them nine days now take seconds. Fannie Mae recently announced they’re working with Palantir, decreasing the time to uncover mortgage fraud from two months down to seconds, saving The U. S. Housing market millions in future fraud losses. Nebraska Medicine President and COO noted they saw a 2100% increase in discharge lounge utilization, which is the equivalent of adding another unit to their hospital. They even noted, We’ve been using the term a Palantir unit of time, and that represents when we’re driving value in less than an hour. Lear Corporation recently signed a five year extension. Over the past two and a half years, they have leveraged Foundry and AIP to support over 11,000 users and more than 175 use cases, including proactively managing their tariff exposure, automating multiple administrative workflows, and dynamically balancing their manufacturing lines. Their CEO highlighted that their enterprise wide adoption gives them, quote, a first mover advantage in the automotive industry, which will be difficult to replicate. Our U. S. Commercial business exited Q2 with a 93% year over year and 20% sequential growth. Due to its acceleration, U. S. Commercial comprised 31% of our Q2 revenue versus 23% a year ago. We continue to focus on delivering AI production impact, evidenced by the strength of new starts and expansions at existing customers. We’re seeing new starts with higher ambition, and existing customers expand their work at a faster rate. A healthcare company completed a bootcamp in April, then signed an $88,000,000 TCV deal a month later to coordinate and automate patient care across facilities. An American telecom company started working with us in 2022 and has increased their contract 10x since then and is now projecting hundreds of millions in cost savings. Our US government business grew 53% year over year and 14% sequentially last quarter, driven by the impact we’re delivering across civil, intel, and defense, including greenfield efforts. US Space Force Space Systems Command awarded us a $218,000,000 delivery order to support seamless synchronized multi domain warfighting for the space and air operational communities. The ceiling for our Maven smart system contract was increased by $795,000,000 to prepare for what they expect will be significant demand from combatant commands for our AI powered software capabilities over the next four years. Last week, Palantir was awarded a ten year enterprise agreement with the Army totaling up to $10,000,000,000 consolidating 75 contracts into a single contract. The Army is one of our longest standing customers. We are honored to embark on this next phase together. We remain focused with deep respect and dedication on equipping our warfighters with decisive advantages over our adversaries. Looking towards the back half of the year, my enthusiasm for our business is at an all time high. With determination and persistence, we’ll continue delivering exceptional AI production impact for our customers, running full speed at the critical challenges they entrust us to solve. I’ll now turn it over to Shyam.

[13] **Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer, Palantir Technologies** Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer, Palantir Technologies: Thanks, Ryan. Twenty years of grinding has built a unique moat and a massive lead. Our products were built for this moment, and the numbers show it. Realizing value from AI in the enterprise requires the elegant integration of LLMs, workflow, and software, and that’s only possible with ontology. As LLMs continue to improve, it only further accelerates the value realization and therefore the value of our products. Our foundational investments in ontology and infrastructure have positioned us to uniquely deliver on the AI demand both now and in the world ahead. A substantial development over the last couple of quarters is the realization and acceleration of our vision of ontology web services as an architectural concept for our customers. AIP isn’t just software our customers use, it’s software our customers are building their software on. Software companies are replatforming away from the highly unopinionated services and building blocks of the hyperscaler stack onto AIP with its highly opinionated building blocks that get you to value 10 times faster. Chris Johnson, the co CEO of Teletracking, who recently replatformed on AIP, said that he was flooded with inquiries from CEOs and CIOs when he went public on his partnership with Palantir. Replatforming on AIP has enabled customers to leapfrog their competition and beat them to market, and this will continue to be both a significant area of investment on our product road map and an accelerating growth opportunity for the business across commercial and government. I mentioned this last quarter. On their earnings calls, CEOs have been highlighting the transformative impact of AIP on their organizations. That trend continues. But also this quarter, you can hear from the frontline workers about the same transformation AIP is bringing them. AI is giving the American worker superpowers. At the all in winning the AI race summit in DC, an ICU nurse, a factory worker, a hospital administrator, an electric vehicle battery maintenance technician shared how AI is making them better, faster, and more productive, giving them more time with patients, more time solving problems, and enabling more workers to access the job market. Our investments in AIFD are accelerating the already eye watering time to value for our customers and providing customers with capabilities to solve bigger and more complex problems independently. AIFD is designed to enable autonomous execution across a wide array of tasks, including creating and editing the ontology, building data transforms, creating functions, debugging issues, and building applications. With its own closed loop error handling, AIFD can identify and correct issues and notify human users if needed. And it’s been designed for seamless collaboration with humans in the loop through integration with AIP’s branching. Warp Speed, our modern manufacturing operating system built on AIP, continues to deliver for our industrial customers, from nuclear companies to the defense industrial base. With MRP speed, a component of warp speed, one of our customers remarked that balancing the production line has shifted from one day to one hour. We have seen a dramatic set of opportunities open up in US shipbuilding as America gets serious about fixing its maritime industrial base. China built more ships last year than we have built cumulatively since the end of World War two. Now the mighty American engine of innovation is spinning up and tackling this problem head on. Maven Smart System met its moment in recent operations of great import. Maven adoption continues to grow with usage doubling again since February. Last quarter, I mentioned that usage doubled in the first nine months of 2024 and doubled again in the subsequent five months. This is on top of that. With that, I’ll turn it over to Dave to take us through the numbers.

[14] **Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer, Palantir Technologies** Dave Glazer, Chief Financial Officer, Palantir Technologies: Thanks, Shyam. We had an unprecedented second quarter, surpassing 1,000,000,000 of revenue in a quarter for the first time and delivering our highest Rule of 40 score ever of 94. Q2 revenue growth accelerated to 48% year over year, exceeding the high end of our prior guidance by nearly 1,000 basis points and representing a 2,100 basis point increase compared to the growth rate in Q2 of last year. On the back of this continued strength, in the third quarter, we are guiding to revenue of 1,085,000,000 representing over 8% growth quarter over quarter, our highest ever sequential revenue growth guide, and 50% growth year over year. We’re also raising our full year 2025 revenue guidance midpoint to $4,146,000,000 representing a 45% year over year growth rate, a nine point increase over our full year 2025 revenue guidance last quarter and our largest ever full year revenue guidance raise. We are also raising our full year U. S. Commercial revenue guidance to an excess of 1,302,000,000 representing a growth rate of at least 85%, 17 points higher than the guidance we gave just last quarter. Accelerating demand for AIP continues to drive the outperformance in our U. S. Business overall, which grew 68% year over year and 17% sequentially in the second quarter. Our U. S. Commercial business grew 93% year over year and 20% sequentially, and our U. S. Government business grew 53% year over year and 14% sequentially. We delivered these outstanding top line results as adjusted operating margin expanded to 46%, exceeding the high end of our prior guidance by nearly 300 basis points. Our revenue and profitability drove an 11 sequential increase to our Rule of 40 score from 83 in the first quarter to 94 in the second quarter. We continue to generate strong cash flow with second quarter adjusted free cash flow of $569,000,000 representing margin of 57%. Turning to our global top line results. Second quarter revenue grew 48% year over year and 14% sequentially to 1,004,000,000.000. Second quarter U. S. Revenue grew 68% year over year and 17% sequentially to $733,000,000 Excluding the impact of revenue from strategic commercial contracts, second quarter revenue grew 49% year over year and 14% sequentially, and second quarter U. Revenue grew 68% year over year and 17% sequentially. Customer count grew 43% year over year and 10% sequentially to eight forty nine customers. Revenue from our largest customers continues to expand. Second quarter trailing twelve month revenue from our top 20 customers increased 30 year over year to $75,000,000 per customer. Now moving to our Commercial segment. Second quarter commercial revenue grew 47% year over year and 14% sequentially to $451,000,000 Excluding the impact from strategic commercial contracts, second quarter commercial revenue grew 49% year over year and 14% sequentially. We closed $1,100,000,000 in commercial TCV bookings, representing 185% growth year over year. AIP continues to drive existing customer expansions and new customer conversions in The U. S. Second quarter U. S. Commercial revenue grew 93% year over year and 20% sequentially to $3.00 6,000,000 Excluding revenue from strategic commercial contracts, second quarter U. S. Commercial revenue grew 95% year over year and 20% sequentially. We had our strongest quarter of U. S. Commercial TCV booked at $843,000,000, representing growth of 222% year over year. Over the past twelve months, we closed 2,800,000,000.0 of U. S. Commercial TCV bookings, a 141% increase from the prior twelve months, highlighting the demand for AI production use cases. Total remaining deal value in our U. S. Commercial business grew 145% year over year and 20% sequentially. Our U. S. Commercial customer count grew to four eighty five customers, reflecting growth of 64% year over year and 12% sequentially. Second quarter international commercial revenue declined 3% year over year and grew 2% sequentially to $144,000,000 For our international commercial business, we continue to capitalize on targeted growth opportunities in Asia, The Middle East, and beyond, but remain focused on accelerating the growth in our U. S. Business. Revenue from strategic commercial contracts was $5,100,000 for the quarter. We anticipate third quarter twenty twenty five revenue from these contracts to be between 2,000,000 to $4,000,000 compared to $10,000,000 in the 2024. We anticipate 2025 revenue from these contracts to be less than half of 1% of full year revenue. Shifting to our Government segment. Second quarter government revenue grew 49% year over year and 14% sequentially to $553,000,000 Second quarter U. S. Government revenue grew 53% year over year and 14% sequentially to $426,000,000 This growth was driven by continued execution in existing programs and new awards reflecting the growing demand for AI in our government software offerings. Second quarter international government revenue grew 37% year over year and 11% sequentially to $127,000,000 bolstered primarily by our continued work in The U. K. We closed our highest ever quarter of TCV bookings at $2,300,000,000 up 140% year over year. This eclipses our prior highest quarter of TCV bookings in Q4 twenty twenty four by nearly $500,000,000 Net dollar retention was 128%, an increase of 400 basis points from last quarter. The increase was driven both by expansions at existing customers and new customers acquired in Q2 of last year as we see the effect of the AI revolution. As net dollar retention does not include revenue from new customers that were acquired in the past twelve months, it does not yet fully capture the acceleration in velocity in our U. S. Business over the past year. We ended the second quarter with $7,100,000,000 in total remaining deal value, an increase of 65% year over year and 20% sequentially, and $2,400,000,000 in remaining performance obligations, an increase of 77% year over year and 27% sequentially. As a reminder, RPO is primarily comprised of our commercial business, as it does not take into account contracts with an initial term of less than twelve months and contractual obligations that fall beyond termination for convenience clauses, both of which are common in most of our government business. Turning to margin and expense. Adjusted gross margin, which excludes stock based compensation expense, was 82% for the quarter. Adjusted income from operations, which excludes stock based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes, was $464,000,000 representing an adjusted operating margin of 46%. Q2 adjusted expense was $539,000,000 up 9% sequentially and 27% year over year, primarily driven by our continued investment in AIP and technical hiring. While we expect adjusted operating margin to continue to expand for the second half of the year, as in prior years, we expect a significant ramp in expenses in the third quarter due to the seasonality of new hire starts. We remain committed to investing in the most elite technical talent, as well as a product pipeline and AI production use cases, all while delivering on our goals of sustained GAAP profitability. Second quarter GAAP operating income was $269,000,000 representing a 27% margin. Second quarter GAAP net income was $327,000,000 representing a 33% margin. Second quarter stock based compensation expense was $160,000,000 and equity related employer payroll tax expense was $35,000,000 Second quarter GAAP earnings per share was $0.13 Second quarter adjusted earnings per share was zero one six dollars Additionally, our combined revenue growth and adjusted operating margin accelerated to 94% in the second quarter, an 11 increase to our Rule of 40 score from the prior quarter and our eighth consecutive quarter of an expanding Rule of 40 score. With the increase in our 2025 revenue and adjusted operating income guidance, we are now guiding to a Rule of 40 score of 91% for the full year. Turning to our cash flow. In the second quarter, we generated $539,000,000 in cash from operations and $569,000,000 in adjusted free cash flow, representing margins of 5457%, respectively. Through the end of the second quarter, we repurchased approximately 2,500,000.0 shares as part of our share repurchase program. As of the end of the quarter, we have $899,000,000 remaining of the original authorization. We ended the quarter with $6,000,000,000 in cash, cash equivalents, and short term U. S. Treasury securities. Now turning to our outlook. For Q3 twenty twenty five, we expect revenue of between 1,083,000,000.000 and $1,087,000,000 and adjusted income from operations of between $493,000,000 and $497,000,000 For full year 2025, we are raising our revenue guidance to between $4,142,000,000 and $4,150,000,000 We are raising our U. S. Commercial revenue guidance to in excess of 1,302,000,000.000 representing a growth rate of at least 85%. We are raising our adjusted income from operations guidance to between 1,912,000,000.000 and $1,920,000,000 We are raising our adjusted free cash flow guidance to between 1,800,000,000.0 and 2,000,000,000 and we continue to expect GAAP operating income and net income in each quarter of this year. With that, I’ll turn it over to Alex for a few remarks, and then Anna will kick off the Q and A.

<a id="post-15"></a>
[15] **Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer, Palantir Technologies** Alex Karp, Chief Executive Officer, Palantir Technologies: Well, as usual, I’ve been cautioned to be a little modest about our bombastic numbers, but it’s honestly, there’s no authentic way to be anything but have enormous pride, and, gratefulness about these extraordinary numbers. Now, when you’re look obviously looking at numbers, there’s numbers and what do they mean. So if you take, I would say, the truly once in a generation number of 93% growth in U. S. Comp off of a large base or even 53% growth in USG, which is astonishing even though obviously it shows where the government is downstream from general trends in AI or the 68% growth in The U. S. You still have to say, you know, why are these numbers even more astonishing than they appear? Well, obviously, you would look at the what what is the meaning of the number? And the rule of 40 basically tells you the meaning of the number. And if that number is somewhere in the fifties, sixties, seventies, that’s pretty baller. When it’s the single most impressive number I’m I think any enterprise software company has ever seen, there is something anomalous going on. And, obviously, the prediction that all the attendees would be downstream from the value, so it would be chips in ontology, is being proven not as a thesis but as a reality. But and then you would obviously ask, well, what is the base? We’re we’re now working off of a very large base getting to a you know, we did our $1,000,000,000 so it’s a very significant run rate. And but then I would say, if you look at a kind of more qualitative version of Palantir, we did this with no compromise in terms of what we believe. We still believe America is the leader of the free world, that the West is superior, that we have to fight for these values, that we should give American corporations and most importantly our government an unfair advantage. We’ve demonstrated in every area and arena of American life and international life that we do deliver an unfair advantage for our allies, our friends, and our compatriots. We have done this by creating a company where every single component is value accretive. There are almost no parasitic elements to this company. We have a small sales force. We have very little BS internally. We have a flat hierarchy. We have the most qualified and interesting people, heterodox in their beliefs. We have an orchestration engine that deploys for deployed engineers everywhere, a model that everyone despised and disdained until literally a quarter ago and thought would lead to a low multiple. Guess you’re wrong. We have we have a series of products that are on the front line, most notably ontology, but also foundry and Maven. And this is a confluence. This is the perfect time for Palantir. And I would also say, at the risk of saying the obvious, this is a perfect time for a revolution in The United States Of America. We are very, very bullish on America. We have some really crucial and important clients internationally, large clients, commercial clients in Europe and also government clients outside of America that we’re proud of. But this is an American revolution. It’s being led by ontology and chips and to also, to some extent, large language model providers. We are also anomalously bullish on all aspects of American life, including and especially people in the blue collar. We’re gonna Shyam and others are leading our charge to arm the working class or blue collar workers with AI agency enhancing skills. AI is an agency enhancing revolution. Our numbers show that. We’ve seen on the front line in the in the United States government that people with less than a college education are creating a lot value and sometimes more value than people with a college education using our product. We’re also gonna reach out to labor leaders and help them organize ways that workers can earn AI enhanced earnings. And and then but in general, what you see in our numbers and the reason it’s so successful is our clients and partners are downstream from our unit economics, and they want our unit economics. And we are teaching them ways in which to work, cultural and with our products that will allow them to get unit economics that look like 94%, 93%, 6853%, respectively. Those numbers are astonishing and incredible, and we’re planning to share them with our partners via exposing them to a way in which to work in an AI revolution so that they have the same kind of agency we do. I run around US commercial telling corporate leaders, if you wanna have your First Amendment rights to an opinion again, get our unit economics, and then you too can say things that are true in public like we do. It’s very motivating to people and very motivating to us. So thank you for all of our supporters, and we should we should entertain questions. But this is a once in a generation, truly anomalous quarter, and we’re very proud. And we’re sorry that, you know, our haters are disappointed, but there are many more quarters to be disappointed, and we’re working on that too.

[16] **Anna Sorrow, Finance Team Member, Palantir Technologies** Anna Sorrow, Finance Team Member, Palantir Technologies: Thanks, Alex. We’ll now turn to questions from our shareholders before opening up the call. We received a question from Christina who asks, beyond just using LLMs, how is Palantir making AI more useful for frontline workers and decision makers, not just data scientists?

<a id="post-17"></a>
[17] **Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer, Palantir Technologies** Shyam Sankar, Chief Technology Officer, Palantir Technologies: Well, thanks, Christina. You know, there’s a surprising amount of doomers and that comes out of the ivory tower, the the folks who are doing AI research. We spend all of our time at the frontline with the factory worker in the fire cell, and the vibe could not be more different. What what we observe is that AI is giving the American worker superpowers. Look at the nurses in the ICU who who have more time to spend with their patients, less time munging around collecting the clinical notes to understand what care to deliver, or the factory workers in the submarine industrial base who get back three days of quitting a part to actually spend time solving problems in production. And perhaps the use case that I’m most excited about around Panasonic Energy were make electric vehicle batteries actually being able to develop AI to train their workers to manage this exquisite high end Japanese technology where the background of the workers is casinos. You know? And I think this is this is job expanding. It’s it’s empowering. To Alex’s point, it’s really pro agency, pro creativity, and that’s a a big reason why we’ve leaned into creating the American Tech Fellowship. Our lived experience is that some of those creative AI applications are coming from the blue collar worker, the autodidact that has a little bit of self taught taught knowledge, not the classically trained computer scientists, not just using AI, but more importantly, building AI applications that are changing their business. We wanna find these people. We wanna empower them, credential them, put them through the training, and unleash them on the American economy.

[18] **Anna Sorrow, Finance Team Member, Palantir Technologies** Anna Sorrow, Finance Team Member, Palantir Technologies: Thank you, Sean. Our next question is from Dan with Wedbush. Dan, please turn on your camera, and then you’ll receive a prompt to unmute your line.

<a id="post-19"></a>
[19] **Dan, Analyst, Wedbush** Dan, Analyst, Wedbush: Thank you. And, I’m, I’m sorry also that the the haters aren’t satisfied, but, look. Can you can you just hit on you’re basically doing this without direct Salesforce. So, like, are you gonna go down that path or it’s just gonna be, you know, prudently going down just given the type of growth you’re seeing? Can you just, like, walk through how you’re thinking about that just given such the massive success you’re having essentially with no direct sales?

[25] **User Trust Advocate** [Risk] Frontline adoption may be surface-level if end users don’t trust algorithmic decisions, especially in high-stakes settings (e.g., clinicians or blue-collar workers wary of “black box” errors), because limited transparency impedes deep behavioral change. | Falsifier: strong survey data showing >80% user trust {Conf: Med} _(🔄 1)_

<a id="post-26"></a>
[26] **Industrial Data Scientist** [Strength] Palantir’s focus on enabling frontline workers (e.g., discharge nurses, factory technicians) to not just use but build and adapt AI/ontology-embedded workflows can create rapid, cumulative productivity cycles—organizational learning compounds as human-machine systems co-evolve. | Falsifier: stagnation in user-driven workflow changes Q/Q {Conf: Med} _(🔄 3)_

<a id="post-27"></a>
[27] **Independent Short-Seller Researcher** [Risk] Heavy reliance on TCV/ACV headlines without breakdown obscures deferred revenue mechanics; rapid TCV growth can overstate near-term actual cash recognition because many government/commercial deals have back-loaded or contingent payment terms. | Falsifier: reveal contract-level revenue schedules {Conf: High} _(🔄 6)_

[28] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What is Palantir Technologies' Q2 2025 Rule of 40 score, and how does this compare to other US-listed enterprise software firms with more than $3 billion in annualized revenue in FY25? A: Palantir Technologies reported a Rule of 40 score of 94% for Q2 2025, combining a 48% year-over-year revenue growth with a 46% adjusted operating margin. ([seekingalpha.com](https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20188086-palantir-reports-q2-2025-u-s-comm-revenue-growth-of-93-percent-y-y-and-revenue-growth-of-48?utm_source=openai)) This exceptional performance positions Palantir favorably among U.S.-listed enterprise software firms with over $3 billion in annualized revenue for FY25. For context, companies like Microsoft and Salesforce have historically reported Rule of 40 scores in the 50s and 60s, respectively. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/2a5d2474-055c-451a-ba58-f6941992bc27?utm_source=openai)) Therefore, Palantir's score significantly surpasses the typical benchmarks in the industry.

<a id="post-29"></a>
[29] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What was Palantir Technologies' percentage of total revenue derived from the United States in Q2 2025, and how has this percentage trended over the past three fiscal years? A: In Q2 2025, Palantir Technologies reported total revenue of $1.004 billion, with U.S. revenue accounting for $733 million, representing approximately 73% of total revenue. This marks an increase from 68% in Q2 2024, indicating a growing reliance on the U.S. market. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000132165525000105/a2025q2ex991pressrelease.htm?utm_source=openai)) Over the past three fiscal years, the U.S. share of Palantir's revenue has risen from 60.94% in 2022 to 66.31% in 2024, reflecting a consistent upward trend.

<a id="post-30"></a>
[30] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What percentage of Palantir's Q2 2025 revenue was derived from U.S. government contracts, and how has this revenue mix changed over the past three years? A: In Q2 2025, Palantir's U.S. government revenue was $426 million, accounting for approximately 42% of its total quarterly revenue of $1.004 billion. ([sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000132165525000105/a2025q2ex991pressrelease.htm?utm_source=openai)) Over the past three years, the proportion of revenue from U.S. government contracts has decreased slightly. In Q2 2022, government revenue was $218 million, 25% higher than the $174 million from commercial clients. By Q2 2023, government revenue increased to $251 million, 23% higher than the $204 million from commercial clients. ([nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-palantirs-growth-too-dependent-on-government-contracts?utm_source=openai)) This trend indicates a gradual shift towards a more balanced revenue mix between government and commercial sectors.

<a id="post-31"></a>
[31] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What was the year-over-year growth rate of Palantir's U.S. commercial revenue in Q2 2025, and how does this compare to the growth rate of its government segment in the same period? A: In Q2 2025, Palantir's U.S. commercial revenue nearly doubled, increasing by 93% year-over-year to $306 million. In contrast, the U.S. government segment saw a 53% year-over-year growth, reaching $426 million. ([ft.com](https://www.ft.com/content/d2f8e180-2b27-48ef-9d70-2d156733d25f?utm_source=openai)) This indicates that the commercial segment's growth rate was significantly higher than that of the government segment during the same period.

### Round 2

<a id="post-32"></a>
[32] **Institutional Tech Analyst** [Strength] Palantir’s 64% YoY growth in U.S. commercial customer count (to 485) demonstrates not only land-and-expand success but diversification across verticals—reducing single-client revenue dependency as contract base broadens. | Falsifier: top-10 clients >65% rev share {Conf: High}
