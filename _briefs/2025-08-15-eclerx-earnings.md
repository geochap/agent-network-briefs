## Executive Summary

eClerx opened FY26 with solid top-line and margin delivery but a conspicuous cash-conversion dip. Management reported USD 109.2m operating revenue (INR 9,346m), EBITDA INR 2,346m (24.8%), PAT INR 1,417m (15%), and $32m in new-deal ACV, with growth broad-based except Fashion & Luxury. Analytics & Automation outpaced the firm at ~6% QoQ. Lima went live and Cairo is slated for Q2. Despite typical Q1 wage hikes and new-center drag, margins held within the 24–28% band, and management pointed to sequential growth again in Q2. The outlier was net operating cash flow of INR 223m (OCF/EBITDA 9.5%) as DSO lengthened to 86 days, which management attributed to temporary client invoicing-system changes and a one-time gratuity fund contribution; they guided DSO back toward 80–82 days over time.

There is broad investor alignment on the structural positives: an IP-led, GenAI-embedded delivery stack (Compliance Manager, QA360, Roboworx) and a large-scale enablement program (8,000 staff trained; targeted Copilot rollout) that supports outcome-priced wins and cushions margins amid vendor consolidation. Everest’s Leaders Quadrant recognition for financial crime and compliance, plus follow-the-sun diversification (India–Lima–Cairo), bolster the narrative of auditability, resilience, and stickier BFSI/CMT demand. If realized at scale, this combination can lift win rates, ACV quality, and revenue-per-FTE without proportional headcount growth. [[154]](#post-154) [[159]](#post-159) [[177]](#post-177) [[179]](#post-179) [[118]](#post-118) [[211]](#post-211) [[214]](#post-214)

The main execution tension is cash conversion. Specialists warn DSO could remain elevated as new entities undergo vendor-master setup and local billing normalization, potentially compounding client P2P migrations and milestone-heavy billing in Tech/Analytics. This risks constraining capital returns if repeated, especially with management signaling Q2 growth, higher FY26 ACV, and the possibility of a buyback. A second layer of friction is convertibility and repatriation from Egypt/Peru—FX devaluations, hard-currency access, and withholding-taxes/approvals can extend cash cycles even if consolidated DSO normalizes. Public disclosures so far lack granularity on receivables aging, contract assets/liabilities, billing model mix, hedge tenor sensitivity, and any evidence of unrestricted repatriations—areas investors will watch for confirmation or disproof. [[151]](#post-151) [[157]](#post-157) [[156]](#post-156) [[153]](#post-153) [[194]](#post-194) [[176]](#post-176) [[221]](#post-221) [[24]](#post-24)

Regulatory and ESG blind spots could slow ACV conversion in BFSI/CX. Egypt and Peru lack GDPR adequacy; cross-border PII/KYC flows require SCCs/BCRs, TIAs, and center-specific ISO 27001/27701/SOC 2 inclusion, none of which are publicly evidenced yet. EU DORA re-papering and audit/access obligations are in force, and EU AI Act limits (e.g., emotion recognition) may require feature adjustments in QA tooling for EU workforces. On labor, Cairo postings show above–living-wage base pay with night allowance and employer transport (including door-to-door for women), yet investors lack site-level social audit certifications, Egypt/Peru data-transfer permits, or Cairo/Lima-specific welfare policies—gaps that could create client-audit friction or delay regulated ramp-ups if not addressed. [[161]](#post-161) [[152]](#post-152) [[163]](#post-163) [[164]](#post-164) [[174]](#post-174) [[192]](#post-192) [[199]](#post-199) [[206]](#post-206) [[178]](#post-178) [[195]](#post-195) [[188]](#post-188) [[200]](#post-200) [[201]](#post-201) [[212]](#post-212) [[209]](#post-209) [[155]](#post-155)

Finally, the growth mix remains in flux. Fashion & Luxury is still weak with no FY26 named wins disclosed; management is leaning on BFSI/CMT and productized compliance modules to backfill. Optionality exists in compliance-driven luxury workloads (EU Digital Product Passport, CSRD traceability) and leveraging Cairo/Lima language capabilities for omnichannel CX/KYC, but tangible evidence of luxury wins tied to these centers is not yet public. The near-term thesis thus hinges on whether IP-led outcome traction and geo-resilience can outpace vertical softness while the company closes documentation gaps in data/privacy compliance and restores cash-conversion cadence.

## Cash Conversion & Working-Capital Dynamics

Q1’s strong P&L met a conspicuous cash-conversion snag. Net operating cash flow fell to INR 223m, with OCF/EBITDA at 9.5%, as DSO lengthened to 86 days; management attributed this to temporary invoice holds from client system migrations and a one-time gratuity fund contribution, and guided DSO back toward 80–82 days over time [[24]](#post-24). The investment question is whether this is a transient working-capital blip or a pattern: new-entity ramps (Lima/Cairo), milestone-heavy billing in Tech/Analytics, and potential cross-border cash frictions could keep cash conversion below earnings if not actively mitigated [[151]](#post-151) [[157]](#post-157) [[194]](#post-194).

Disclosure gaps complicate assessment. Public materials reiterate the temporary nature of holds and the reversion goal, but they don’t show receivables aging (including >90-day bucket), segment-wise DSO, contract assets/liabilities, or billing-mix clarity—data that would help investors separate timing issues from structural shifts in the cash cycle [[185]](#post-185) [[221]](#post-221). FX mix and hedge tenor are disclosed at a high level, but local-currency cash/repatriation practices for Egypt/Peru are not, keeping convertibility risk an open variable [[176]](#post-176).

### Supporting Voices

“Cash conversion collapse (OCF/EBITDA 9.5%)—partly due to gratuity funding—still flags working-capital risk; DSO stretch to 86 days + client P2P migrations can normalize longer terms, while Lima/Cairo ramps and milestone-heavy Tech/Analytics billing tie cash to delivery, constraining buyback/M&A firepower if repeated.” — Private Equity Diligence Partner; Support: 10 [[157]](#post-157)

“Launching Lima and Cairo could extend elevated DSO because new legal entities require client vendor-master setup, tax/withholding validation, and PO policy mapping; when combined with clients’ ongoing system migrations, invoices can be held longer despite delivery ramp.” — Delivery Center Director, APAC; Support: 9 [[151]](#post-151)

“Parent-level FCF may trail EBITDA even if DSO normalizes because cash generated in new Cairo/Lima entities can be delayed by FX liquidity, capital controls, dividend/royalty approvals, and withholding taxes; mechanism: offshore cash accumulates, slowing buybacks/M&A despite accounting profit.” — Quantitative Macro Strategist; Support: 8 [[194]](#post-194)

“What was disclosed: consolidated DSO rose to 86 days in Q1 FY26; management said the increase was due to some large clients migrating invoicing/purchase-order systems that put invoices on hold (they described these as temporary holds, not changes to contractual payment terms) and said they expect DSO to revert to ~80–82 days. What I could not find…: a receivables‑aging table (showing the >90‑day bucket) and a segment‑wise DSO breakout.” — Institutional Investor Relations Specialist; Support: 10 [[185]](#post-185)

### Minority / Dissent

“Mgmt said DSO rise stems from temporary invoice holds during client system migrations…, not changed payment terms; extrapolating ‘normalized longer terms’ and buyback/M&A constraint is speculative. Also, Q1 margin decline was smaller than usual, aided by offshore mix—supporting internal cash generation into H2 if DSO reverts.” — Institutional Investor Relations Specialist; Support: 5 [[193]](#post-193)

### Analysis

The split is between a cautious camp that sees plausible drivers of persistently longer cash cycles (new-entity onboarding, milestone billing, and potential Egypt/Peru convertibility frictions) and a more sanguine view that treats Q1 as a one-off timing dislocation likely to unwind. The debate hinges on evidence the company has not yet published: receivables aging, unbilled/contract assets, billing-mix cadence, and concrete proof of rapid, unrestricted repatriations. If DSO reverts to 80–82 days and OCF/EBITDA rebounds, concerns about capital-return capacity fade; if not, buyback/M&A optionality and sentiment could be constrained despite solid EBITDA. Key uncertainties are the speed of client P2P stabilization, the working-capital impact of Cairo/Lima ramps, and country-level FX/capital controls that don’t show up in consolidated DSO.

## Cross-Border Data Privacy & Financial-Services Compliance

Cross-border personal-data processing is now central to eClerx’s BFSI/CX strategy as Cairo and Lima come online, but both Egypt and Peru lack EU GDPR adequacy, forcing reliance on appropriate transfer safeguards and supplementary measures. Public materials state SCC use, yet no company-specific SCC/BCR/TIA artifacts or center-level ISO 27001/27701/SOC 2 inclusions for Cairo/Lima are publicly posted, and analysts could not find a public statement of DORA readiness or executed addenda—gaps that can slow ACV conversion for regulated workloads if client audits demand documentary evidence. [[161]](#post-161) [[164]](#post-164) [[163]](#post-163) [[199]](#post-199)

The regulatory bar is rising: EU DORA applies from Jan 2025 with 24–72 hour incident reporting, audit/access rights, exit/data-location, and sub-outsourcing transparency; DPDP cross-border transfer rules in India were still pending formal notification as of mid-August 2025; and EU AI Act limits (e.g., “emotion recognition”) could require configuration changes to QA tooling for EU workforces. Country-specific requirements (Egypt PDPL/PDPC, CBE outsourcing, Peru ANPD/SBS) may add licensing/approval layers for cross-border BFSI/KYC, with no public site-level attestations yet. [[206]](#post-206) [[220]](#post-220) [[178]](#post-178) [[165]](#post-165) [[209]](#post-209) [[212]](#post-212)

### Supporting Voices

“EU DORA (effective Jan 2025) compels EU FIs to re‑paper ICT/ops outsourcing with 24–72h incident reporting, full audit/access, data‑location/exit terms, and sub‑outsourcing transparency. Mechanism: Cairo/Lima cross‑border KYC/CX and GenAI tooling must evidence EU‑grade logging/testing and segregation; lacking this slows ACV conversion and raises compliance cost.” — Emerging Markets Regulator; Support: 10 [[192]](#post-192)

“Has eClerx publicly posted updated ISO 27001 certificate scope and SOC 2 (Type II) reports that include the Cairo (Egypt) and Lima (Peru) delivery centers, and if so, what are the issue dates and scope boundaries?” — ESG Investment Analyst; Support: 10 [[174]](#post-174)

“Has eClerx publicly documented Egypt PDPL controller/processor registration, any CBE approvals, Peru ANPD/SBS filings or approvals, and the SCCs/BCRs/TIAs used for cross‑border KYC/CX processing from Cairo/Lima to India/EU/US, with effective dates and scopes?” — Emerging Markets Regulator; Support: 10 [[212]](#post-212)

“I could not find any public FY25–FY26 disclosure from eClerx that states explicit DORA readiness/compliance for EU financial‑services clients (no public note of executed DORA contractual addenda, no third‑party ‘DORA’ audit attestation, and no SOC report mapped to DORA requirements)…” — Emerging Markets Regulator; Support: 10 [[199]](#post-199)

### Minority / Dissent

“Compliance/controls moat forming: Everest Leaders Quadrant (Financial Crime & Compliance Ops), 8,000 staff GenAI upskilled via TUM, and QA/agentic tooling in KYC/CX together improve auditability, lower conduct risk, and increase switching costs amid vendor consolidation—supporting stickier BFSI growth and margin resilience. CSO100 and FE CFO awards signal governance rigor. [Status: INCONCLUSIVE] impact magnitude.” — AI Services Product Manager; Support: 2 [[175]](#post-175)

“Bundling LLM-agnostic, audit-ready ‘edge’ modules (PII redaction, prompt-guarding, full model logs, on‑prem inferencing) into Compliance Manager/QA360 can unlock GenAI on client networks, cutting security-approval cycles and lifting outcome-priced attach in BFSI/CMT. Mechanism: neutralizes data-risk objections.” — AI Services Product Manager; Support: 3 [[182]](#post-182)

### Analysis

The dominant view is that cross-border privacy/compliance documentation and EU-grade operational resilience requirements are now gating factors for regulated ACV conversion, especially with Egypt/Peru lacking adequacy and DORA contract terms in force; investors are asking for center-specific ISO/SOC scopes, SCC/BCR/TIA artifacts, and evidence of executed DORA addenda. The counterview argues eClerx’s controls/tooling and industry recognition may already mitigate audit friction, but it lacks public, site-level proofs. Key uncertainties: timing and completeness of published artifacts (ISO/SOC scopes for Cairo/Lima; SCCs/TIAs; PDPL/SBS approvals), DPDP cross-border rules finalization, EU AI Act feature configurations for EU workloads, and whether clients accept productized “audit-ready” modules as sufficient for DORA-grade obligations. Until documentation is visible, compliance remains an execution bottleneck risk for BFSI/CX ramps.

## Cairo & Lima Expansion: Operational Risk, FX, and Geo-Resilience

Lima is live and Cairo is slated to go live in Q2, and management plans to leverage these centers to expand footprint in existing accounts and new logos, especially in CMT and BFSI operations where offshore growth is strong [[63]](#post-63) [[96]](#post-96). The strategic upside is geographic diversification and language capability that can widen addressable demand and strengthen operational resilience.

Execution risk sits in the cash cycle and country mechanics. New legal entities typically lengthen vendor‑master setup and invoicing readiness, which, combined with client P2P system migrations, can keep DSO elevated and push out cash even as delivery ramps [[151]](#post-151). A second layer is macro/FX: recent devaluations and intermittent hard‑currency access in Egypt/Peru can require pre‑funding payrolls and delay profit repatriation, compressing parent‑level OCF even if reported DSO normalizes; to date, the company has not disclosed center‑level cash balances or evidence of unrestricted repatriations from these markets [[153]](#post-153) [[194]](#post-194) [[172]](#post-172). Offsetting this, follow‑the‑sun coverage can enhance resilience and win‑rates, and the USD‑heavy revenue versus largely INR/EGP/PEN costs profile can provide FX operating leverage in INR terms if local currencies remain soft [[211]](#post-211) [[190]](#post-190).

### Minority / Dissent

“Follow-the-sun diversification (India+Lima+Cairo) is macro-resilience accretive: it reduces single-country outage risk, aligns with EU/UK operational-resilience expectations, and can justify stickier BFSI/KYC contracts or premium SLAs amid vendor consolidation. Mechanism: time-zone redundancy and geo failover lift win-rates and pricing power.” — Client-side IT Transformation Lead; Support: 7 [[211]](#post-211)

“Mgmt said DSO rise stems from temporary invoice holds during client system migrations (per oracle_14), not changed payment terms; extrapolating “normalized longer terms” and buyback/M&A constraint is speculative. Also, Q1 margin decline was smaller than usual, aided by offshore mix—supporting internal cash generation into H2 if DSO reverts.” — Institutional Investor Relations Specialist; Support: 5 [[193]](#post-193)

### Analysis

The dominant view emphasizes working‑capital and repatriation frictions from new‑entity ramps and local FX constraints, arguing these can mute capital‑return capacity even as P&L scales. The dissenting camp stresses resilience and mix benefits and treats the DSO spike as a transient invoicing‑migration issue. The disagreement hinges on evidence not yet public: speed of vendor‑master onboarding and client P2P stabilization, concrete proof of timely USD conversions/repatriations from Egypt/Peru, and whether DSO reverts to the 80–82 day range alongside a rebound in OCF/EBITDA conversion [[151]](#post-151) [[157]](#post-157) [[172]](#post-172). FX operating leverage could cushion INR margins if local currencies remain soft, but convertibility—not headline rates—will drive parent‑level cash realization [[190]](#post-190) [[153]](#post-153).

## GenAI-Led Productization & Margin Strategy

Management is positioning GenAI-embedded, IP-led delivery (Compliance Manager, QA360, Roboworx) as the engine to convert FTE seats into outcome-priced, higher‑ACV work that scales without linear headcount, cushioning margins even as deal cycles lengthen. The thesis: concrete enablement (8,000 staff trained; targeted Copilot rollout) plus standardized, audit‑ready modules can accelerate approvals, lift attach rates, and support premium pricing and revenue/FTE gains—keeping EBITDA within the 24–28% band despite wage and new‑center drag [[154]](#post-154) [[177]](#post-177) [[179]](#post-179).

The strategy’s credibility rests on two levers investors can track: (a) demonstrable outcome baselines packaged into KPI‑based SLAs to speed vendor‑consolidation decisions and price for value; and (b) productized “edge” controls (redaction, prompt‑guarding, logs, on‑prem inference) that lower client security friction. Execution proof will be whether outcome‑based ACV mix rises through H1 and whether pricing/productivity gains are visible by Q4 [[196]](#post-196) [[182]](#post-182) [[154]](#post-154) [[179]](#post-179).

### Minority / Dissent

“EU AI Act bans workplace ‘emotion recognition’; eClerx’s QA use of speech-to-text + sentiment analytics for agent quality could be construed as emotion recognition if applied to EU workforces, compelling feature disablement, redesign, or fines—slowing EU CX ramp via Cairo/Lima. [Status: INCONCLUSIVE]” — Emerging Markets Regulator; Support: 0 [[178]](#post-178)

### Analysis

The dominant view is that eClerx’s GenAI‑led productization is already reducing approval friction and monetizing outcomes, with published KPI baselines and large‑scale enablement underpinning margin resilience and larger ACVs without proportional headcount. The main challenge is regulatory edge‑cases: if EU AI Act interpretations require disabling sentiment/emotion features, or if clients demand additional attestations before enabling GenAI at scale, the attach‑rate and pricing thesis could slow. Key uncertainties investors should watch: H1 shift in outcome‑based ACV mix [[154]](#post-154), evidence of accelerated security approvals/attach tied to “edge” modules [[182]](#post-182), and visible productivity/pricing gains by Q4 [[179]](#post-179) alongside standardized KPI‑based SOW adoption [[196]](#post-196).

## ESG, Labor Welfare, and Governance Transparency

Investors are scrutinizing how well eClerx’s expansion into Cairo and Lima aligns with regulatory, social, and governance expectations in regulated workloads (BFSI/KYC, CX). Two threads dominate: visible improvements in governance communications and early labor‑welfare signals in Cairo; and persistent disclosure gaps on site‑level data‑privacy/security attestations and social audits that could slow client approvals and heighten audit friction. Questions also remain on India’s DPDP implementation and cross‑border transfer governance for processing routed through Egypt/Peru.

On governance transparency, management added KPI and balance‑sheet metrics, explicitly explained the DSO/OCF dip, and disclosed a one‑time gratuity fund contribution—moves that reduce information asymmetry. On labor, Cairo job ads indicate living‑wage‑plus pay and safer mobility (including door‑to‑door night transport for women). However, investors still lack public, site‑specific ISO/SOC scopes including Cairo/Lima, documented transfer mechanisms/assessments, local PDPL/SBS approvals, and third‑party social/labor audits—key artifacts for EU/BFSI client audits and cross‑border compliance comfort.

### Analysis
The dominant view is bifurcated: investors welcome clearer governance communications and encouraging Cairo wage/transport signals, but remain concerned about missing, site‑specific compliance artifacts (ISO/SOC scopes naming Cairo/Lima; SCCs/BCRs/TIAs; Egypt PDPL/SBS approvals; third‑party social audits). Minority views either warn that on‑the‑ground labor conditions and grievance channels could still pose audit/attrition risks despite upbeat job ads, or argue that eClerx’s compliance/controls posture is already a moat. The key uncertainties are whether eClerx publishes center‑level certificates and regulatory approvals, formalizes social‑audit coverage for Cairo/Lima, and sustains Cairo’s wage/transport practices in a way that translates into lower attrition and smoother BFSI client audits.

## Materiality & Impact Assessment

### Theme 1 — Cash Conversion & Working-Capital Dynamics

#### Scale
- Material to capital allocation and sentiment. Net operating cash flow was INR 223m in Q1 FY26 with OCF/EBITDA at 9.5%, versus EBITDA of INR 2,346m and DSO elongated to 86 days, which management attributed to client P2P migrations and a one‑time gratuity fund contribution [[24]](#post-24). If elevated DSO, milestone-heavy billing, or entity‑onboarding frictions persist, buyback/M&A firepower could be constrained despite solid P&L delivery [[157]](#post-157) [[156]](#post-156).

#### Timing
- Immediate in Q1 FY26; management expects DSO to revert toward the historical 80–82 day range and guided for Q2 sequential revenue growth [[76]](#post-76) [[99]](#post-99). Evidence to confirm normalization will come with Q2 prints (DSO/OCF) and any capital‑return decisions discussed after the 12‑month buyback gap lapses [[156]](#post-156) [[69]](#post-69).

#### Dependencies
- Client P2P migrations and invoice holds resolve without embedded term changes.
  - [Dependency 1]
  - [Dependency 2]
- New‑entity onboarding (vendor‑master/PO/tax) completes without recurring invoice deferrals in Lima/Cairo [[151]](#post-151).
  - [Dependency 3]
- Contract assets/liabilities and billing mix (T&M vs milestone/outcome) do not structurally tie cash to delivery in a way that suppresses OCF in growth quarters [[215]](#post-215) [[221]](#post-221).
- Any Egypt/Peru cash generated is convertible and repatriable on normal timelines (see Theme 3) [[194]](#post-194) [[172]](#post-172).

#### Net Impact
- Ambiguous. If DSO reverts to 80–82 days and OCF/EBITDA rebounds, the Q1 dip is a timing blip and capital‑return credibility improves [[193]](#post-193). If invoice holds morph into longer cycles, entity ramps add unbilled exposure, or repatriation lags, cash conversion can remain below earnings, pressuring buybacks/M&A even as margins hold [[157]](#post-157) [[151]](#post-151) [[194]](#post-194).

---

### Theme 2 — Cross-Border Data Privacy & Financial-Services Compliance

#### Scale
- High for regulated ACV conversion. Egypt and Peru lack GDPR adequacy; cross‑border KYC/PII requires SCCs/BCRs and TIAs plus center‑specific ISO 27001/27701/SOC 2, none of which are publicly evidenced for Cairo/Lima; client audits or a breach could halt KYC workloads and trigger fines [[161]](#post-161) [[152]](#post-152) [[163]](#post-163) [[164]](#post-164). EU DORA is in force (24–72h incident reporting, full audit/access rights, exit/data‑location, sub‑outsourcing transparency), likely requiring re‑papering and attestation; absence of public DORA readiness disclosures adds friction [[206]](#post-206) [[192]](#post-192) [[199]](#post-199).

#### Timing
- Near‑term, coincident with Cairo going live in Q2 and Lima already live in Q1 FY26 [[63]](#post-63). DORA obligations apply from Jan 2025; DPDP cross‑border rules were still being finalized as of Aug 15, 2025, leaving additional uncertainty for India→Egypt/Peru transfers [[206]](#post-206) [[220]](#post-220).

#### Dependencies
- Publish center‑inclusive ISO 27001 scope and SOC 2 Type II or provide under NDA; disclose issue dates/scope boundaries [[174]](#post-174) [[163]](#post-163).
  - [Dependency 1]
- Execute and document SCCs/BCRs and TIAs for EU/UK→Egypt/Peru transfers; confirm absence of adequacy is mitigated [[161]](#post-161) [[164]](#post-164).
  - [Dependency 2]
- Obtain/attest local approvals (Egypt PDPL/PDPC, CBE; Peru ANPD/SBS) for cross‑border BFSI/KYC processing [[165]](#post-165) [[212]](#post-212) [[209]](#post-209).
  - [Dependency 3]
- Configure EU‑specific QA/GenAI features to avoid EU AI Act “emotion recognition” risk for EU workforces [[178]](#post-178).

#### Net Impact
- Downside‑skewed until documentation is visible. Strong controls/tooling and industry recognition may help, but without public (or readily shareable) artifacts and executed DORA addenda, regulated ACV conversion may slow or incur higher compliance cost [[175]](#post-175) [[192]](#post-192) [[199]](#post-199).

### Theme 3 — Cairo & Lima Expansion: Operational Risk, FX, and Geo-Resilience

#### Scale
- Strategically positive for diversification and language‑led growth; resilience across time zones can lift win‑rates and pricing in BFSI/CX amid vendor consolidation [[211]](#post-211) [[96]](#post-96). Financially mixed: new entities can elevate DSO during vendor‑master setup; FX devaluations and hard‑currency access constraints can elongate cash cycles and delay repatriation, compressing parent OCF even as revenue scales [[151]](#post-151) [[153]](#post-153) [[194]](#post-194). FX operating leverage may be a tailwind given USD‑heavy revenue and INR/EGP/PEN costs [[190]](#post-190).

#### Timing
- Immediate: Lima live in Q1; Cairo going live in Q2 [[63]](#post-63). Repatriation/convertibility effects can surface over multiple quarters; absence of disclosed Egypt/Peru cash balances or repatriation evidence keeps near‑term uncertainty high [[172]](#post-172).

#### Dependencies
- Efficient entity onboarding (vendor‑master/PO/tax/withholding mapping) to avoid invoice holds and DSO creep [[151]](#post-151).
  - [Dependency 1]
- Ability to convert and remit USD from Egypt/Peru consistently; withholding‑tax and approvals manageable within normal cycles [[153]](#post-153) [[194]](#post-194) [[207]](#post-207).
  - [Dependency 2]
- Documented resilience benefits recognized in deals (explicit SLAs/citations) to monetize geo‑coverage [[211]](#post-211).
  - [Dependency 3]
- Maintain wage/transport practices to control attrition and ramp quality in Cairo (see Theme 5) [[195]](#post-195) [[200]](#post-200).

#### Net Impact
- Mixed. Geo‑resilience and language capability bolster strategic positioning and can support pricing, but near‑term cash‑cycle and repatriation risks can offset P&L gains at the parent level. Convertibility, not just FX rates, will drive realized OCF [[211]](#post-211) [[153]](#post-153) [[194]](#post-194).

---

### Theme 4 — GenAI-Led Productization & Margin Strategy

#### Scale
- Potentially structural. IP‑led services (Compliance Manager, QA360, Roboworx) with Gen/Agentic AI and large‑scale enablement (8,000 staff upskilled; targeted Copilot rollout) underpin larger ACVs and seatless scale, supporting margin resilience within the 24–28% band and outcome‑priced wins amid consolidation [[154]](#post-154) [[177]](#post-177) [[179]](#post-179) [[214]](#post-214) [[140]](#post-140) [[78]](#post-78). A&A outpaced the firm at ~6% QoQ in Q1, reinforcing traction [[63]](#post-63). Usage‑based pricing and metered modules could smooth OCF cadence as deal cycles lengthen [[217]](#post-217).

#### Timing
- Already visible in Q1 FY26 (A&A growth; Copilot rollout plan; 8,000 trained) [[63]](#post-63) [[140]](#post-140) [[78]](#post-78). Management and external posts suggest checkpoints through H1–Q4 FY26: rising outcome‑based ACV mix in H1; productivity/pricing gains visible by Q4 if execution lands [[154]](#post-154) [[179]](#post-179).

#### Dependencies
- Standardize KPI‑based SLAs/SOWs using published outcome baselines (automation rate, audit coverage, agent uplift) to support premium pricing and faster decisions [[196]](#post-196).
  - [Dependency 1]
- Bundle “edge” controls (PII redaction, prompt‑guarding, logs, on‑prem inference) to reduce client security‑approval friction [[182]](#post-182).
  - [Dependency 2]
- Align GenAI/QA features with EU AI Act limits for EU workforces to avoid rework/slowdowns (see Theme 2) [[178]](#post-178).
  - [Dependency 3]
- Commercialization shifts (usage‑based pricing) adopted in contracts to decouple cash cadence from milestones [[217]](#post-217).

#### Net Impact
- Positive with regulatory caveats. If outcome‑based mix rises and “edge” modules reduce approval friction, revenue/FTE and margins can improve without proportional headcount. Missteps on EU AI Act or lack of standardized SLAs could slow attach/pricing gains [[154]](#post-154) [[182]](#post-182) [[178]](#post-178).

---

### Theme 5 — ESG, Labor Welfare, and Governance Transparency

#### Scale
- Governance communications improved: management added KPI/balance‑sheet slides and explained DSO/OCF and the gratuity fund move, reducing information asymmetry and supporting capital‑return credibility [[210]](#post-210). Labor signals in Cairo are constructive: job postings show base pay above the 2024 urban living‑wage with night allowance and employer transport (door‑to‑door for women), which can stabilize attendance and QA continuity during ramp [[195]](#post-195) [[188]](#post-188) [[200]](#post-200) [[204]](#post-204).
- However, absence of publicly posted site‑level social audits (SMETA/SA8000/ISO 45001), Cairo/Lima‑inclusive ISO/SOC scope documents, and local approvals can create audit friction for BFSI/CX ramps [[201]](#post-201) [[174]](#post-174) [[163]](#post-163) [[209]](#post-209).

#### Timing
- Immediate governance and labor signals in Q1/Q2 FY26 (slides added; Cairo postings dated Mar 2025) [[210]](#post-210) [[200]](#post-200). Audit/attestation gaps persist as of Aug 15, 2025 and may affect near‑term client audits and ACV conversion in regulated workloads [[201]](#post-201) [[174]](#post-174).

#### Dependencies
- Sustain Cairo wage/transport practices through ramp to control attrition and pass client social audits [[195]](#post-195) [[200]](#post-200).
  - [Dependency 1]
- Publish site‑specific social audits/certifications or attestations covering Cairo/Lima (wages, hours, grievance, union rights) [[201]](#post-201) [[189]](#post-189).
  - [Dependency 2]
- Publish or provide (under NDA) ISO/SOC scope including Cairo/Lima to satisfy client/regulated‑entity audits (see Theme 2) [[174]](#post-174) [[163]](#post-163).
  - [Dependency 3]

#### Net Impact
- Ambiguous. Governance transparency aids investor confidence, and early Cairo labor signals de‑risk ramp. But missing site‑level social and security attestations remain gating items for regulated client approvals; until addressed, audit and onboarding friction may persist [[210]](#post-210) [[195]](#post-195) [[201]](#post-201) [[174]](#post-174).

Cross-Theme Interaction Summary

✅ Cash Conversion & Working-Capital Dynamics ↔ Cairo & Lima Expansion: Operational Risk, FX, and Geo-Resilience — New-entity onboarding and FX/convertibility in Egypt/Peru can keep DSO elevated and delay parent OCF even as delivery scales [[151]](#post-151) [[153]](#post-153) [[194]](#post-194).

✅ Cash Conversion & Working-Capital Dynamics ↔ GenAI-Led Productization & Margin Strategy — Shift to outcome/usage-based pricing and standardized SLAs can raise attach and convert larger ACVs into higher-frequency invoices, smoothing OCF if adopted [[217]](#post-217) [[196]](#post-196).

✅ Cross-Border Data Privacy & Financial-Services Compliance ↔ Cairo & Lima Expansion: Operational Risk, FX, and Geo-Resilience — Egypt/Peru lack GDPR adequacy; Cairo/Lima ramps require SCCs/BCRs/TIAs and local PDPL/SBS/CBE approvals to unlock regulated BFSI/KYC workloads [[161]](#post-161) [[152]](#post-152) [[165]](#post-165) [[212]](#post-212) [[209]](#post-209).

✅ Cross-Border Data Privacy & Financial-Services Compliance ↔ GenAI-Led Productization & Margin Strategy — “Edge” controls and audit logs embedded in Compliance Manager/QA360 can reduce security-approval friction; EU AI Act constraints may require EU-specific configurations [[182]](#post-182) [[178]](#post-178).

✅ ESG, Labor Welfare, and Governance Transparency ↔ Cairo & Lima Expansion: Operational Risk, FX, and Geo-Resilience — Living‑wage+ pay and safe transport in Cairo can reduce attrition and training cost during ramp; lack of site social audits may still trigger client audit friction [[195]](#post-195) [[188]](#post-188) [[201]](#post-201).

✅ ESG, Labor Welfare, and Governance Transparency ↔ Cross-Border Data Privacy & Financial-Services Compliance — Publishing Cairo/Lima‑inclusive ISO/SOC scopes and local approvals (PDPL/SBS) strengthens audit outcomes and speeds regulated ACV conversion [[174]](#post-174) [[163]](#post-163) [[209]](#post-209).

✅ Cash Conversion & Working-Capital Dynamics ↔ ESG, Labor Welfare, and Governance Transparency — Clearer KPI/balance‑sheet disclosures reduce information asymmetry around DSO/OCF, narrowing the expectation‑management gap on capital returns [[210]](#post-210) [[156]](#post-156).

## Emerging Clusters & Factions

Five distinct clusters emerged, reflecting a split between balance‑sheet/margin optimism and caution around cash conversion and regulatory gating. The debate coalesced around five themes: working‑capital and repatriation risk, cross‑border data/privacy compliance, the strategic but execution‑sensitive Cairo/Lima expansion, GenAI‑led productization, and ESG/labor transparency.

### Cluster 1: Working‑Capital Realists

- DSO elevation may persist as new entities (Lima/Cairo) navigate vendor‑master/PO/tax setup, compounding client P2P migrations; Q1’s OCF/EBITDA collapse (9.5%) is a warning, not a blip, unless proven otherwise [[151]](#post-151) [[157]](#post-157) [[185]](#post-185).
- Parent OCF can lag EBITDA even if consolidated DSO normalizes due to FX convertibility, capital‑control frictions, and withholding taxes in Egypt/Peru; buyback/M&A capacity could be constrained without evidence of timely repatriations [[153]](#post-153) [[194]](#post-194) [[172]](#post-172) [[207]](#post-207).
- Push for disclosure on receivables aging, contract assets/liabilities, billing‑mix cadence, and currency/repatriation practices to separate timing noise from structural cash‑cycle drift [[215]](#post-215) [[221]](#post-221) [[176]](#post-176) [[185]](#post-185).
- Key voices: Private Equity Diligence Partner, Delivery Center Director, APAC, Quantitative Macro Strategist.

### Cluster 2: Compliance Hardliners

- Cairo/Lima raise cross‑border PII/KYC exposure: Egypt/Peru lack GDPR adequacy; require SCCs/BCRs, TIAs, and center‑specific ISO 27001/27701/SOC 2. Absence of publicly posted, center‑inclusive artifacts is a gating risk for BFSI workloads [[161]](#post-161) [[152]](#post-152) [[163]](#post-163) [[164]](#post-164) [[174]](#post-174).
- EU DORA is live (24–72h incident reporting; audit/access; data‑location/exit; sub‑outsourcing transparency). No public DORA‑readiness or executed contractual addenda located; expect re‑papering friction and higher compliance cost until attested [[206]](#post-206) [[192]](#post-192) [[199]](#post-199).
- Local approvals likely needed (Egypt PDPL/PDPC; CBE; Peru ANPD/SBS) for cross‑border BFSI/KYC; investors want published permits/letters or clear attestations [[165]](#post-165) [[212]](#post-212) [[209]](#post-209).
- EU AI Act constraint: potential need to disable/modify “emotion recognition”‑like QA features for EU workforces to avoid compliance risk [[178]](#post-178).
- Key voices: Emerging Markets Regulator, ESG Investment Analyst.

### Cluster 3: Productization Optimists

- IP‑led, Gen/Agentic‑AI‑embedded delivery (Compliance Manager, QA360, Roboworx) converts FTE seats to outcomes, supporting larger ACVs without linear headcount and bolstering margin resilience in the 24–28% band [[154]](#post-154) [[177]](#post-177) [[214]](#post-214).
- Execution credibility: 8,000 staff upskilled; targeted Copilot rollout; A&A outgrew the firm in Q1. Standardizing KPI‑based SLAs using published outcome baselines and bundling “edge” controls (PII redaction, prompt‑guarding, model logs, on‑prem inference) can cut security‑approval times and lift attach/pricing [[179]](#post-179) [[140]](#post-140) [[63]](#post-63) [[196]](#post-196) [[182]](#post-182).
- Commercial levers: shift select products to usage‑based pricing to smooth OCF cadence amid longer ACV cycles [[217]](#post-217).
- Key voices: AI Services Product Manager, Client‑side IT Transformation Lead.

### Cluster 4: Governance & Workforce Pragmatists

- Governance transparency improved: management added KPI/balance‑sheet slides and explained the DSO/OCF dip and gratuity contribution—reducing information asymmetry and aiding capital‑return credibility [[210]](#post-210).
- Cairo labor signals are constructive: job ads show living‑wage‑plus base pay, night allowances, and employer transport (door‑to‑door for women), which can stabilize attendance and reduce attrition during ramp [[195]](#post-195) [[188]](#post-188) [[200]](#post-200) [[204]](#post-204).
- Still, site‑level attestations are missing: no public social/labor audits (SMETA/SA8000/ISO 45001) naming Cairo/Lima; call for published policies/audits to pass client social due‑diligence cleanly [[201]](#post-201) [[189]](#post-189) [[219]](#post-219).
- Key voices: Institutional Investor Relations Specialist, Cairo Delivery Site Community Advocate, ESG Investment Analyst.

### Cluster 5: Luxury Pivot Advocates

- Fashion & Luxury remains weak with no FY26 named Cairo/Lima wins disclosed; however, language‑led delivery (Arabic/Spanish) and compliance‑driven mandates (EU Digital Product Passport, CSRD) could backfill via auditable data‑ops and omnichannel CX/KYC [[85]](#post-85) [[166]](#post-166) [[184]](#post-184) [[205]](#post-205) [[160]](#post-160) [[218]](#post-218).
- Thesis is optionality, not base‑case: monitor for disclosed pilots/wins tied to Cairo/Lima to validate the pivot [[160]](#post-160) [[218]](#post-218).
- Key voices: Sector Specialist, Fashion & Luxury BPO.

### Analysis

#### Convergences

- Broad agreement that Cairo/Lima bring strategic upside (language, follow‑the‑sun resilience) but impose execution frictions—entity onboarding, client P2P migrations, and regulatory approvals that can slow ACV conversion and cash realization [[151]](#post-151) [[211]](#post-211) [[153]](#post-153) [[165]](#post-165).
- Shared view that documentation gaps matter: investors want center‑inclusive ISO/SOC scopes, SCCs/BCRs/TIAs, and local PDPL/SBS/CBE approvals; absence can delay regulated BFSI/KYC ramps [[174]](#post-174) [[163]](#post-163) [[212]](#post-212) [[199]](#post-199).
- Recognition that eClerx’s GenAI/productized stack is a core strength with credible enablement (8,000 trained; Copilot plan) and visible A&A outperformance—though magnitude and monetization cadence still need proof points [[179]](#post-179) [[140]](#post-140) [[63]](#post-63) [[196]](#post-196).

#### Fault‑Lines

- Cash conversion: Realists argue Q1’s OCF/EBITDA collapse plus DSO stretch could persist via onboarding and convertibility headwinds; Sentiment balancers counter that DSO reflects temporary invoice holds and should revert to 80–82 days, normalizing OCF and easing buyback constraints [[157]](#post-157) [[151]](#post-151) [[194]](#post-194) [[193]](#post-193).
- Compliance sufficiency: Hardliners demand published artifacts and DORA re‑papering evidence; Optimists argue embedded “edge” controls and industry recognition will neutralize audit friction—pending public, site‑specific proofs [[192]](#post-192) [[174]](#post-174) [[182]](#post-182) [[175]](#post-175).
- AI policy risk: Regulators flag EU AI Act “emotion recognition” constraints for QA tools; Productization advocates expect EU‑specific configurations to mitigate, but no public memo/config confirmation is cited [[178]](#post-178) [[182]](#post-182).
- ESG execution: Workforce pragmatists highlight Cairo wage/transport positives; ESG analysts still want third‑party social audits and site policies to pass client due‑diligence—tension between early signals vs. formal attestations [[195]](#post-195) [[200]](#post-200) [[201]](#post-201) [[219]](#post-219).
- Luxury strategy: Advocates see compliance‑mandated work and language hubs enabling a pivot; skeptics point to the absence of disclosed wins as of FY26‑to‑date [[160]](#post-160) [[218]](#post-218) [[166]](#post-166) [[184]](#post-184).

## Top Reinforced Points & Network Propagation

### Cash Conversion Collapse Risk

> “<add: [Risk] Cash conversion collapse (OCF/EBITDA 9.5%)—partly due to gratuity funding—still flags working-capital risk; DSO stretch to 86 days + client P2P migrations can normalize longer terms, while Lima/Cairo ramps and milestone-heavy Tech/Analytics billing tie cash to delivery, constraining buyback/M&A firepower if repeated. | Falsifier: Q2 OCF/EBITDA >60% and DSO ≤82 {Conf: Med}>” [[157]](#post-157)

- Reinforced by: Private Equity Diligence Partner; Quantitative Macro Strategist; Institutional Investor Relations Specialist
- Endorsement Level: High (10×)
- Propagation Reason: Crisp metric (OCF/EBITDA 9.5%) and a concrete falsifier threshold made it the anchor for the cash-conversion debate; cross-theme relevance to capital returns and growth credibility.
- Role in Discourse: Early warning and consensus base for working-capital scrutiny.

### New-Entity DSO Drag

> “<add: [Risk] Launching Lima and Cairo could extend elevated DSO because new legal entities require client vendor-master setup, tax/withholding validation, and PO policy mapping; when combined with clients’ ongoing system migrations, invoices can be held longer despite delivery ramp. | Falsifier: DSO back to 80–82 by Q2 {Conf: Med}>” [[151]](#post-151)

- Reinforced by: Delivery Center Director, APAC; Private Equity Diligence Partner; Institutional Investor Relations Specialist
- Endorsement Level: High (9×)
- Propagation Reason: Operational mechanics (vendor-master/PO/tax) explained the DSO spike in practical terms; offered a near-term falsifier tied to management guidance.
- Role in Discourse: Causal mechanism and scenario framing for WC risk.

### Offshore Cash Repatriation Risk

> “<add: [Risk] Parent-level FCF may trail EBITDA even if DSO normalizes because cash generated in new Cairo/Lima entities can be delayed by FX liquidity, capital controls, dividend/royalty approvals, and withholding taxes; mechanism: offshore cash accumulates, slowing buybacks/M&A despite accounting profit. [Status: UNKNOWN] repatriation policy/timelines, hedge coverage. | Falsifier: Egypt/Peru remits consistently within 30 days {Conf: Med}>” [[194]](#post-194)

- Reinforced by: Quantitative Macro Strategist; Private Equity Diligence Partner; Emerging Markets Regulator
- Endorsement Level: High (8×)
- Propagation Reason: Added a second-order constraint (convertibility/approvals) that persists even if DSO normalizes; clear falsifier and explicit country linkage boosted spread.
- Role in Discourse: Structural risk extension and capital-returns sensitivity check.

### DORA Re‑Papering Burden

> “<add: [Risk] EU DORA (effective Jan 2025) compels EU FIs to re‑paper ICT/ops outsourcing with 24–72h incident reporting, full audit/access, data‑location/exit terms, and sub‑outsourcing transparency. Mechanism: Cairo/Lima cross‑border KYC/CX and GenAI tooling must evidence EU‑grade logging/testing and segregation; lacking this slows ACV conversion and raises compliance cost. [Status: UNKNOWN] | Falsifier: EU client DORA addenda executed + audit attestation {Conf: Med}>” [[192]](#post-192)

- Reinforced by: Emerging Markets Regulator; ESG Investment Analyst; Client-side IT Transformation Lead
- Endorsement Level: High (10×)
- Propagation Reason: Timely regulatory trigger with concrete obligations and a clear execution bottleneck for EU BFSI workloads; actionable falsifier increased utility.
- Role in Discourse: Compliance gating lens and execution checklist.

### Package Outcome Baselines

> “<add: [Strength] eClerx already publishes concrete A&A outcome baselines (Compliance Manager ≈60% KYC data automation/≈35% cost down; QA360: 100% audit coverage/≈35% agent uplift). Packaging these into standard KPI-based SLAs/SOW templates can speed vendor-consolidation decisions and support premium pricing without proportional headcount. | Falsifier: No shift to KPI-based SOW templates {Conf: Med}>” [[196]](#post-196)

- Reinforced by: AI Services Product Manager; Client-side IT Transformation Lead; Institutional Investor Relations Specialist
- Endorsement Level: High (10×)
- Propagation Reason: Bridges product claims to commercial levers (SLA/SOW standardization), aligning with margin resilience and consolidation narratives; includes falsifier.
- Role in Discourse: Monetization playbook and value-pricing catalyst.

### Governance Transparency Improves

> “<add: [Strength] Incremental governance transparency: management added KPI/balance-sheet slides, explicitly discussed DSO drivers/timeline and made a large gratuity-fund contribution—reducing information asymmetry and signaling long-termism. Mechanism: clearer cash/working-capital narrative lowers perceived ESG/governance discount and supports capital-return credibility. | Falsifier: Q2 slides drop cash/DSO details or gratuity underfunded {Conf: Med}>” [[210]](#post-210)

- Reinforced by: Institutional Investor Relations Specialist; ESG Investment Analyst
- Endorsement Level: High (9×)
- Propagation Reason: Balanced counterweight to cash-risk posts; connects disclosure quality to sentiment and capital-return credibility; practical falsifier keeps management accountable.
- Role in Discourse: Credibility anchor and sentiment stabilizer.

### Cairo Wage and Transport Edge

> “<add: [Strength] Cairo CX hiring signals above-market, living‑wage+ pay and safer mobility, de‑risking ramp: an eClerx Cairo ad lists 15,527 EGP net base + night allowance + employer transport (door‑to‑door for women), exceeding the 2024 urban living‑wage (12,448 EGP) and typical Cairo BPO bases (7–13k). Mechanism: stronger take‑home and safe night commute lift attendance, female participation, and QA continuity—supporting BFSI/CX audit readiness. [Status: UNVERIFIED KYC pay] | Falsifier: Cairo attrition > India or transport benefit withdrawn {Conf: Med}>” [[195]](#post-195)

- Reinforced by: Cairo Delivery Site Community Advocate; ESG Investment Analyst; Delivery Center Director, APAC
- Endorsement Level: High (10×)
- Propagation Reason: Concrete, locally anchored evidence that ties welfare to ramp quality and audit readiness; complements compliance threads with social-operational risk mitigation.
- Role in Discourse: Social proof and ramp-risk mitigant.

## Recommendations

Widely Supported
* Tie any near-term capital-return expectations to cash conversion recovery – assume no new buyback until Q2 evidences DSO ≤82 days and OCF/EBITDA >60% as falsifiers for the Q1 slump; re-weight positions accordingly if these are not met. [[156]](#post-156) [[157]](#post-157) [[167]](#post-167) [[162]](#post-162)
* Demand working-capital transparency before revising FCF estimates – ask IR for Q2 receivables aging (including >90‑day bucket), segment-wise DSO, contract assets and liabilities movements, and billing mix (T&M vs milestone/outcome) or unbilled‑DSO; adjust models only when these are provided. [[185]](#post-185) [[215]](#post-215) [[221]](#post-221)
* Apply a collections‑lag buffer to Cairo/Lima ramps in models – treat new‑entity vendor‑master, tax/withholding, and PO mapping as likely to elongate DSO until client P2P migrations stabilize; release the buffer if Q2 DSO reverts to 80–82 days as guided. [[151]](#post-151) [[75]](#post-75) [[76]](#post-76) [[193]](#post-193)
* Treat Egypt/Peru convertibility and remittance as a parent‑level FCF constraint – haircut cash availability for potential FX liquidity and approval lags; de‑risk only after eClerx evidences unrestricted USD repatriations for two consecutive quarters and clarifies withholding/tax leakage. [[153]](#post-153) [[194]](#post-194) [[172]](#post-172) [[207]](#post-207)
* Gate regulated‑workload growth assumptions on published controls – require center‑inclusive ISO 27001 scope and SOC 2 (Type II) reports that name Cairo/Lima and dated SCCs/TIAs for EU/UK transfers; treat BFSI/KYC ACV conversion as slower/higher‑cost until these artifacts are shared. [[174]](#post-174) [[163]](#post-163) [[164]](#post-164) [[152]](#post-152) [[161]](#post-161)
* Haircut EU BFSI ramp expectations for DORA re‑papering – assume added friction and cost until executed DORA addenda and audit/access attestations are evidenced; lift the haircut once client confirmations are obtained. [[192]](#post-192) [[199]](#post-199) [[206]](#post-206)
* Incorporate balanced ESG signals into risk premia – give partial credit for improved KPI/balance‑sheet disclosure and gratuity funding transparency, but maintain a social‑audit risk discount for Cairo/Lima until third‑party site‑level labor audits/certifications and Cairo‑specific welfare policies are publicly available. [[210]](#post-210) [[201]](#post-201) [[219]](#post-219) [[189]](#post-189)
* Use Cairo wage/transport evidence as a ramp‑quality indicator, not a substitute for audits – treat the living‑wage+ base, night allowance, and employer transport (door‑to‑door for women) as supportive of lower attrition and audit readiness, but do not reduce diligence on social and data audits. [[195]](#post-195) [[188]](#post-188) [[200]](#post-200) [[204]](#post-204)
* Keep Fashion & Luxury contribution conservative – assume continued softness and no Cairo/Lima‑led lift until named wins or pipeline disclosures materialize; lean on BFSI/CMT and A&A outperformance for near‑term growth assumptions. [[85]](#post-85) [[184]](#post-184) [[166]](#post-166) [[63]](#post-63)

Experimental / Watch-list
* Treat outcome‑based/IP‑led monetization as upside optionality – monitor H1 FY26 for a rising outcome‑priced ACV mix and Q4 proof of productivity/pricing gains from Gen/Agentic‑AI‑embedded IP; only then consider raising revenue‑per‑FTE and margin assumptions. [[154]](#post-154) [[179]](#post-179) [[177]](#post-177)
* Track standardization signals before underwriting faster ACV conversion – look for adoption of KPI‑based SLA/SOW templates using published outcome baselines (e.g., Compliance Manager, QA360) and for reduced security‑approval times tied to “edge” controls (PII redaction, logs, on‑prem inference); treat faster conversions as contingent. [[196]](#post-196) [[182]](#post-182)
* Watch for usage‑based pricing and billing‑cadence benefits – treat any shift to usage‑metered contracts as a potential OCF smoother for larger ACVs; incorporate only after disclosures or contract examples are reported. [[217]](#post-217)
* Monitor onboarding friction fixes – evidence of a PMO‑run “Go‑Live” toolkit that shortens time‑to‑first‑invoice (vendor‑master/PO templates, milestone‑to‑invoice designs) would justify easing working‑capital buffers; absent public materials, keep conservative TTFI/TTB assumptions. [[191]](#post-191) [[202]](#post-202) [[198]](#post-198)
* EU AI Act exposure check – for EU workforces, seek confirmation that QA/sentiment features avoid “emotion recognition” or are EU‑configured; until confirmed, apply a modest timing risk to EU CX module rollouts. [[178]](#post-178)
* Luxury pivot catalysts – treat EU Digital Product Passport/CSRD data‑ops as optionality; add probability weight only if pilots or wins are disclosed in FY26 and/or if Cairo/Lima secure luxury CX/KYC wins by Q4. [[218]](#post-218) [[160]](#post-160) [[166]](#post-166)
* FX and hedge disclosure gap – don’t assume INR‑accretive FX leverage without explicit sensitivity; seek updated FY26 revenue/cost currency mix, hedge tenor/coverage, and EBITDA sensitivity to 1% moves, plus Egypt/Peru repatriation practices. [[176]](#post-176) [[186]](#post-186) [[190]](#post-190)
* India DPDP ruleset uncertainty – monitor final cross‑border transfer notifications; if rules constrain India→Egypt/Peru flows, reassess routing assumptions and compliance costs. [[220]](#post-220)
* Buyback narrative risk – treat “possible” buyback as a call‑option contingent on OCF recovery and DSO normalization; don’t front‑run board action given 2024 program is completed and no new authorization is disclosed. [[69]](#post-69) [[173]](#post-173) [[156]](#post-156)

## Expert Network Questions

### **Profile 1 – Global BPO Working-Capital CFO (billing design, cash conversion)**
* When large clients migrate P2P/PO systems, which pre-onboarding artifacts most reliably avoid “invoice holds” (e.g., vendor‑master data packs, PO/tax mappings, e‑invoicing format tests), and what lead‑time do you require to keep DSO in line with historical ranges?
* For new legal entities (e.g., Egypt/Peru), what step-by-step playbook minimizes first‑invoice delays, and how do you structure milestone schedules to reduce unbilled DSO exposure during early ramps?
* Which billing models have proven to improve operating‑cash‑flow cadence in practice—outcome/usage‑metered monthly billing vs milestone‑heavy or T&M—and how do you engineer acceptance criteria to prevent cash slippage?
* What receivables‑aging patterns and contract‑assets movements indicate structural stretch rather than temporary timing? What disclosures would you ask management to provide (e.g., >90‑day bucket trends, segment DSO, contract liabilities) to validate normalization?
* After a quarter with unusually low OCF/EBITDA, how would you redesign collections governance (credit control, dispute resolution, escalation) to restore conversion to target within the next quarter?
* What commercial or legal levers do you deploy if invoice holds persist (e.g., interim billing, revised acceptance triggers, stop‑work clauses), and how do you re‑paper without harming client relationships?
* How would you operationalize a PMO‑run “Go‑Live Kit” to compress time‑to‑first‑invoice across BFSI/CMT (templates for vendor‑master/PO, milestone‑to‑invoice design, standard acceptance checklists)?

### **Profile 2 – Cross-Border Privacy & Financial-Services Compliance Counsel (EU + Egypt/Peru)**
* For EU→Egypt/Peru transfers involving KYC/PII, what exact documentary bundle consistently clears client audits: SCC module selection, Transfer Impact Assessment depth, supplementary technical measures, and center‑scoped ISO 27001/27701/SOC 2? What must be publicly posted versus shared under NDA?
* Under DORA, which contracting points create the most friction with offshore providers (full audit/access rights, data‑location and exit, sub‑outsourcing transparency), and what evidence do EU financial entities expect to map SOC/ISO controls to those clauses?
* What local approvals are actually required to process cross‑border BFSI/KYC from Egypt and Peru (privacy authority permits, central‑bank/SBS notifications or authorizations), typical timelines, and consequences if permits lag while clients want to ramp?
* How should QA/sentiment analytics be configured for EU workforces to avoid being classified as “emotion recognition” under the EU AI Act, and what DPIA language or policy artifacts do buyers expect to see?
* With India’s DPDP cross‑border rules still finalizing, what interim contractual and governance positions should an Indian processor adopt when routing personal data to Egypt/Peru (e.g., transfer addenda, data‑minimization patterns, role‑of‑processor clarifications)?
* What due‑diligence red flags most often stall Cairo/Lima onboarding (e.g., lack of site‑specific ISO scope statements, incomplete sub‑processor inventories, missing logging/segregation attestations), and how do you pre‑empt them?

### **Profile 3 – Emerging‑Markets Treasury/FX Repatriation Specialist (Egypt & Peru convertibility and remittances)**
* What are the practical timelines to convert local currency to USD and remit dividends/fees from Egypt and Peru to an Indian parent, and which bank/tax documents are critical to avoid delays at the point of remittance?
* Which early‑warning indicators signal tightening hard‑currency access (bank queueing, off‑market pricing, regulator circulars), and how should a provider adapt cash‑pooling, payroll pre‑funding, and intercompany settlement when those signals flash amber?
* How do you optimally sequence intercompany flows (service fees, royalties, dividends) to minimize withholding‑tax leakage and approval frictions while maintaining arm’s‑length pricing and audit defensibility?
* Which hedging instruments are realistically executable at local‑entity level for payrolls and receivables in Egypt/Peru, and how do you set tenor and sizing when convertibility risk dominates over pure FX‑rate risk?
* What governance and disclosures would give you confidence that offshore cash won’t accumulate (e.g., country cash balance reporting, repatriation SLAs, board‑level KPIs, breach thresholds that trigger escalation)?
* If consolidated DSO improves but parent‑level OCF still lags, how would you diagnose the driver mix between unbilled revenue growth, silent payment‑term shifts at clients, and repatriation/convertibility constraints—and what corrective actions follow from each diagnosis?

[1] **Pratik Jagtap** Pratik Jagtap: Hi, everyone. Good day, and welcome to the Q1 FY26 Earnings Call of eClerx Services Limited. Please note that this webinar will be recorded. To take us through the results and to answer your questions, we have with us the top management of eClerx represented by Kapil Jain, Managing Director and Group CEO; and Srinivasan Nadadhur, Chief Financial Officer. We will start the call with brief opening remarks by Kapil, followed by Srinivasan, who will be sharing the financial update, and then we will open the floor for Q&A session. As usual, I would like to remind you that anything that is mentioned on this call that gives any outlook for the future or which can be construed as forward-looking statement, must be viewed in conjunction with the risks and uncertainties that we face. These risks and uncertainties are included but not limited to what we have mentioned in the prospectus filed with SEBI and subsequent annual reports, which you can find on our website. Having said that, I will now hand over the floor to Kapil. Over to you, Kapil.

<a id="post-2"></a>
[2] **Kapil Jain** FY26 has started on a positive note, and we will continue to build on this momentum. We are grateful to our clients and partners for having placed their trust in us and for giving us the opportunity to be part of their journey. We look forward to their continued support in the future. Thank you, and over to Srini for more details.

<a id="post-3"></a>
[3] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: Thanks for letting me know the Street expectation, Sandeep.

<a id="post-4"></a>
[4] **Pratik Jagtap** Pratik Jagtap: Thank you, Sandeep. We have the next follow-up question from the line of Girish Pai from BOB Capital Markets.

<a id="post-5"></a>
[5] **Girish Pai** Girish Pai: I just want to dig a little deeper into the GCC situation. So, you've been saying that you've been working with GCCs for a very long period of time. What would be the percentage exposure as percentage of your total revenue now? If you can give that number, would it be mid, high single-digit type?

<a id="post-6"></a>
[6] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: So, you asked 3 questions. One was the percentage of revenue. When you said percentage of revenue coming in from GCC versus the clients, like the same client from U.S. or Europe?

<a id="post-7"></a>
[7] **Girish Pai** Girish Pai: No. As a percentage of the total turnover, how much is coming from GCCs?

<a id="post-8"></a>
[8] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: We don't count in terms of revenue that is coming from GCC. We count revenue on client index vertical and geography-wise. When I said we were already collaborating with GCCs in ops, KPO, if you look at, we are working with clients in financial services space, which majority of them have a GCC in presence. So, we are collaborating, cooperating and working along with GCC and delivering the value to our clients. That gives us an edge to leverage the GCC. I think the question that was asked that a lot of SIs have created a separate unit vertical. So, we also have a dedicated team to sell into GCCs now, which is what I said that we are building on top of what we already existed from a collaboration point of view in GCCs. Did I answer your question?

<a id="post-9"></a>
[9] **Girish Pai** Girish Pai: I think 2 other questions regarding the kind of work you do now versus, say, 5 years back on the GCC side?

<a id="post-10"></a>
[10] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: The work that we do today versus 5 years back, obviously, we have moved up the value chain because repetitive task, which is there, it has either got eliminated or automated either by client or by us. So, the nature of work, the complexity of work has increased.

<a id="post-11"></a>
[11] **Kapil Jain** The nature of work with GCCs, as I said, I think it goes back to the previous answer that I gave that we are not differentiating that, look, this is the work specifically I'm doing for GCC or for the client. It's like what we are delivering it as a service. And we have created a dedicated team. So, the nature of work, the only thing I would add is we are also working on the technology side with GCCs, which, let's say, 5 years back, we may not have been working.

<a id="post-12"></a>
[12] **Girish Pai** Girish Pai: Insourcing. In-sourcing threat, have you seen episodes of in-sourcing happening? And how have you handled it?

<a id="post-13"></a>
[13] **Srinivasan Nadadhur** Srinivasan Nadadhur: Thank you, Kapil, and good evening, everyone. I will provide some additional detail on our performance this quarter. So, as Kapil mentioned, the performance this quarter has been strong on both the revenue and the margin fronts. In constant currency terms, operating revenue was up 3.3% sequentially and 16.4% YoY. Including other income of INR 105 million, total revenue was INR 9,451 million, up 3.1% sequentially and 17.7% YoY. On a QoQ basis, there was margin decline in both EBITDA and PAT of about 250 and 160 bps, respectively, owing to the annual wage hikes and the impact of the new delivery centers. This is lower than the decline usually seen and was achievable, thanks to the strong top line growth in BFSI and CMT Offshore, enabling us to hire at the bottom of the pyramid.

<a id="post-14"></a>
[14] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: We haven't seen that in terms of except I think when in Q3 of '24, one of the clients that we were working with, did look at in-sourcing. But other than that, we have not seen that impact.

<a id="post-15"></a>
[15] **Girish Pai** Girish Pai Okay. My second question has to do with margins and the impact of Gen AI on margins. You said you keep some of it and then you pass on some back to the client. So, does that help in the overall context of margins, does that help?

<a id="post-16"></a>
[16] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: I think it's difficult to say whether it's margin, we are looking at the overall top line and bottom line. And then we take a business call along with the client in terms of what are the benefits we would pass on to the client. And I think it's a discussion that we have with the clients and then we make a call. It's

<a id="post-17"></a>
[17] **Kapil Jain** eClerx Services Limited July 25, 2025 15 not like you would only look at margin. We'll also look at what is the value we are bringing to the client? And are we helping them get better? Are we helping them enhance their end user experience, retention of their clients. And in a holistic manner then we take a call.

<a id="post-18"></a>
[18] **Girish Pai** Girish Pai: No, I'm asking in recent quarters, has Gen AI helped you add to the margins that you have now?

<a id="post-19"></a>
[19] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: We don't look at in terms of whether Gen AI has helped. I think from an overall perspective, what we are looking for is, am I staying relevant for the client? Am I helping clients to stay in compliance with the regulators and the jurisdiction in which they are working from, our compliance and KYC practice that we have. To say whether Gen AI has helped me on the margin, I think we cannot quantify. But I would think that GenAI and our technology ability is helping us both on the top line as well as on the margin.

<a id="post-20"></a>
[20] **Pratik Jagtap** Pratik Jagtap: Thank you, Girish. We have the next question from the line of Aashray Vasa from Nippon.

<a id="post-21"></a>
[21] **Aashray Vasa** Aashray Vasa: Congrats on the results. Sir, I was of the opinion or, correct me if I'm wrong, macro uncertainties impact KPOs and BPO or our offerings slightly lesser than IT services. But you have kind of mentioned twice about macro uncertainties. Is it just delay decision making, more roll offs, just any color on that, how to connect the strong performance of our company over the last few quarters versus the macro uncertainties that you are kind of seeing? And just second question on the gratuity transfer, Srini, sir, just when was this last done I know you called out the auditors mentioned it but this. Can you give any more color on that or is it just a regular practice time to time?

<a id="post-22"></a>
[22] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: Aashray, I'll answer the first question, and I'll pass on to Srini for gratuity. I think we are not seeing any increased uncertainty from an overall macroeconomic environment. However, and which is what is making me say that we are cautiously optimistic. You don't know what you don't know. In terms of the actual thing is the only thing we have experienced is a delayed decision-making, which you're right. Other than that, I think, like I said, on Q2, which is short-term, we are optimistic to show QoQ growth. Beyond that, we will let you know as we meet in the next earnings call. Does that answer your question?

<a id="post-23"></a>
[23] **Aashray Vasa** Aashray Vasa: Yes, sir.

<a id="post-24"></a>
[24] **Srinivasan Nadadhur** You will notice that we have added a couple of slides, one on key performance indicators and the second on balance sheet metrics, which show a long-term view of our performance in a graphical format. And we hope that you find these slides useful. One thing that I'd like to call out on this slide is the net operating cash flow of INR 223 million and the EBITDA conversion metric, 9.5% in Q1, are much lower than usual. There are a couple of reasons for this. Number one is that DSO has gone up from 80 days to 86 days. This is because of system and process changes in some of our large clients, resulting in invoices being hold for some time. These are clients with whom we have tenured relationships, and I want to emphasize that there is no risk to collections. The second reason is that we made a large contribution to our gratuity fund basis advice from our auditors. The contribution is tax deductible, and the returns are tax-free, and this will reduce our liabilities in future. Without these 2, the Q1 net OCF would have been higher than that of last year. Another point to note is that we pay annual bonuses in Q1. So Q1 in general does tend to be lower than Q2 to Q4.

<a id="post-25"></a>
[25] **Srinivasan Nadadhur** Srinivasan Nadadhur: So, on the gratuity, we had applied to shift our gratuity from LIC to HDFC way back in 2019. And then COVID happened and somehow that application got lost, we lost track of it. And when the auditors brought it up, then we realized that this hadn't been completed. And we did that process, we got it approved and we got the fund approved, transferred and then we made a big payment in this quarter. For the last 4, 5 years, we've been paying as we go. So, this is a significant contribution that we have not made in the past.

<a id="post-26"></a>
[26] **Pratik Jagtap** Pratik Jagtap: Thank you, Aashray. We have the follow-up question from the line of Dipesh Mehta from Emkay Global.

<a id="post-27"></a>
[27] **Dipesh Mehta** Dipesh Mehta: I think partly you answered, but I will just try to get more detail about the delay in decision making because you said we expect a full-year deal, ACV, to be better. Now earlier is better for revenue conversion in that year. The delay in deal closure obviously has implications for future growth, not in the immediate period. In that context, I just want to understand whether delay in decision-making could have some bearing on your growth expectation for the current year? Or do you think things are fairly stable and it is as per plan kind of thing?

<a id="post-28"></a>
[28] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: So Dipesh, as I said, we don't comment QoQ for full year, we expect, and as you would have seen we have shown growth on ACV on a YoY basis. If you look at Q1 of last year versus Q1 of this year, we have shown growth. Sequentially, yes, we have declined. We continue to expect the same momentum as we had last year across the quarters. So, we don't see a major change in the overall mix. And that's all I can comment at this point in time. And in addition to that, I've also said that we are expecting a higher ACV than what we delivered in FY25.

<a id="post-29"></a>
[29] **Dipesh Mehta** Dipesh Mehta: So, sir, let me ask it slightly differently, whether this delay in decision-making is an area of concern for you, which could have some bearing about plan or you think it is broadly stable in last 3, 4 months, nothing unusual?

<a id="post-30"></a>
[30] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: The delay in decisioning is happening. As of now, I'm not concerned with the delays that are coming. However, if there is a further delay in clients' decision-making, yes, that can have an impact. But as of now, we don't see the delay, whatever has happened will impact the trajectory that we are on.

<a id="post-31"></a>
[31] **Pratik Jagtap** Pratik Jagtap: Thank you, Dipesh. We have the next follow-up question from the line of Jalaj from SVAN Investment.

<a id="post-32"></a>
[32] **Jalaj Manocha** Jalaj Manocha: Sir, with regards to the margins, I wanted to understand one thing. So, while you had joined in post that, there was a discussion around margins being under slight pressure because of the investments which we were trying to make. Would it be fair to assume that we have made those investments and from now this higher margin should be a new normal?

<a id="post-33"></a>
[33] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: So Jalaj, like I said in my previous earnings call, we are a growth business INR 400 million growth business. So, we'll continue to invest in the growth and margin guidance we have given will stay eClerx Services Limited July 25, 2025 17 between 24% to 28%.

<a id="post-34"></a>
[34] **Jalaj Manocha** Jalaj Manocha: Okay. So, I just wanted to understand, has the investment phase been over or it's a continuous process for us. That was the agenda I wanted to understand.

<a id="post-35"></a>
[35] **Srinivasan Nadadhur** Coming to the P&L, I had mentioned last quarter about a reclass of 120 bps from delivery to sales. So that reclass, last quarter had resulted in a higher S&D cost last quarter, 14.1% of revenue and excluding that, the Q1 S&D of 12.3% is roughly down about 60 bps QoQ. D&A as a percentage of revenue has gone down, as happens every Q1, because of the recalculation of WDV in the new financial year. And on the other key metrics, top 10 concentration has reduced by 1%. We have added about 750 seats in our Airoli facility in Navi Mumbai. Attrition at 18% is lower than Q4 and about the same as Q1 of last year. Staff utilization is down by about 0.5%. And I have already touched upon DSO earlier.

<a id="post-36"></a>
[36] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: Investments will continue. We'll continue to invest to drive the top line growth in the business.

<a id="post-37"></a>
[37] **Jalaj Manocha** Jalaj Manocha: Okay. More so from a perspective of propensity of those spends they would have reached to a certain level. That was the directionally I wanted to understand. And then have we reached to a threshold of where the incremental spending would not be as much as required?

<a id="post-38"></a>
[38] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: When you say as much as required, meaning? Whatever is required, we will continue to invest to drive the top line growth. But as long as we are delivering through the guidance that we have given on the sequential growth, on the top line growth that we will be in the top quartile of the competitor set. We'll continue to invest in the business. And if we are not, then investors should be concerned that why are we delivering a higher margin, why are we not investing for growth.

<a id="post-39"></a>
[39] **Jalaj Manocha** Jalaj Manocha: Just trying to understand the intensity, but that answers. And sir, just one more question with regards to M&A. Sir we are sitting on a decent amount of cash right now. And every few years, we have been doing a few tuck-ins. So what are your thoughts around the M&A? Are we looking actively and any spaces we are specifically looking out for them?

<a id="post-40"></a>
[40] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: Yes, we are looking. We have a dedicated senior person who is focusing on M&A. However, we are very clear, we are not going to do an M&A to just get the top line revenue. We need to look at adjacent areas, which is what we are looking at, and bring in synergistic value, either on the service capabilities that we have or on the client access. And as and when we find the right opportunity, and obviously, the valuation has to be right, we will consider it and look at it. So ,we are absolutely looking at inorganic and M&A assets on a continuous basis, but we will only do it when it makes right sense for us.

<a id="post-41"></a>
[41] **Debashish Mazumdar** Debashish Mazumdar: Hi Kapil, this is Debashish. Just a follow-up on the acquisition point. So if I see the history of eClerx, every 3 to 4 years we used to do a comparatively larger size acquisition as compared to the size that we used to operate into. And largely, we use those acquisitions to enter into either new geographies or completely new verticals or completely new capabilities. So just trying to understand what would be your strategy? Your strategy would be a tuck-in acquisition or kind of acquiring a larger sized company to get into a new business altogether? So that is the agenda of this question.

<a id="post-42"></a>
[42] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: So Debashish, whether it's a tuck-in or larger size, I'm more focused on the other attributes. If I acquire a company, can I deliver an alpha basis, either the capabilities that I'm delivering to the client or the vertical access that I have access to, the clients have access to, right? So, either it enhances my capability eClerx Services Limited 18 side or it enhances the client access that I can take a new capability and take it to the client, right? So that's the synergistic value. Is it both top line and bottom line accretive? Can it continue to give me the growth. If I am delivering the growth that I'm delivering, it should deliver an alpha on the growth that I'm delivering. And third is the valuation has to be right. So instead of size, whether it's a tuck-in or a large-sized acquisition, these are the attributes or framework on which I'm evaluating the assets on the acquisition side.

<a id="post-43"></a>
[43] **Pratik Jagtap** Pratik Jagtap: Thank you Jalaj & Debashish. We have the next question from the line of Pratik Dharmshi from Union

<a id="post-44"></a>
[44] **Pratik Dharmshi** MF. Pratik Dharmshi: I Apologies if I'm repeating this question, I was slightly delayed in the call. How should one see Gen AI to impact our business or we benefiting out of it? How should one see the overall scheme of things, Gen AI for us?

<a id="post-45"></a>
[45] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: So Pratik, like I have said in the previous earnings call, as well as I think this question was asked earlier as well, we see this as an advantage given the way we deliver services to our client. And we are embedding Gen AI in our domain-specific applications, IP that we use to deliver services, be it KYC, Compliance Manager, QA 360 that we are bringing in to deliver services to the clients. And this will help deliver value to the clients on efficiency, effectiveness as well as enhance overall experience.

<a id="post-46"></a>
[46] **Srinivasan Nadadhur** So that concludes our prepared remarks. We can now move on to the Q&A. Back to you, Pratik.

<a id="post-47"></a>
[47] **Pratik Dharmshi** Pratik Dharmshi: Got it. And just a second one on hiring trends, we have seen incremental net hirings at our end, which is contrary to what we have seen with other IT names. So how should we see hiring trends evolving, considering we have a strong ACV? It's a precursor basically that this should continue to be robust going forward?

<a id="post-48"></a>
[48] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: As I said, for Q2, we are reasonably confident to show sequential growth. Beyond that we will give more color on Q3 and Q4. There was also a question on H2 versus H1, which I answered. If you look at companies that have delivered 3% to 4% growth QoQ I think the hiring is in line with the demand that we see as well as the expansion that we are seeing in the new geos.

<a id="post-49"></a>
[49] **Pratik Jagtap** Pratik Jagtap: Thank you, Pratik. We have next question from the line of Sandeep Shah from Equirus Securities.

<a id="post-50"></a>
[50] **Sandeep Shah** Sandeep Shah: Sir, just wanted to understand what can go wrong in your consistent growth journey over the last 8 quarters despite the weak macro? And this question is outside macro concern, what other things which can go wrong in terms of, A in terms of client-specific issue and B in terms of any technology-related risk?

<a id="post-51"></a>
[51] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: Sandeep, it's like a Johari window. I don't know, I don't know. So, what can go wrong, I think there are things that I can have control on. So, I think we are focusing in terms of what we have to do to drive the growth, continue to drive value for our clients, continue to stay ahead of the curve from a technology point of view. In terms of what can go wrong is like in an infinite set of outcomes. I don't want to comment in terms of what can go wrong. But I can comment in terms of what we are doing and what our focus is and what our strategy is.

<a id="post-52"></a>
[52] **Sandeep Shah** Sandeep Shah: Okay. And sir, last thing, when you took a control as a CEO, you also highlighted one of the area of investment would be larger deals. If it requires some investment in the larger deals, we won't shy out to do that. Any such deals are shaping up in the pipeline?

<a id="post-53"></a>
[53] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: There are a mix. I won't comment on specific deals. But yes, I continue to maintain what I had said that we will not shy away in investing for our clients, with our clients on deals and which I also mentioned earlier that some of the benefits that we are getting due to bringing technology, Gen AI, we are not shying away from passing that on to our clients.

<a id="post-54"></a>
[54] **Pratik Jagtap** Pratik Jagtap: Thank you, Sandeep. As this was the last question, I will hand over the floor to the management for closing comments.

<a id="post-55"></a>
[55] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: Thank you, everyone, for your continued support. And as you know, this is our 25th year of existence, and we are celebrating it in a big way. Thank you for all your support for all these years and look forward to meeting you in the next quarter.

<a id="post-56"></a>
[56] **Pratik Jagtap** Pratik Jagtap: Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Kapil and Srini.

<a id="post-57"></a>
[57] **Pratik Jagtap** Pratik Jagtap: Thank you, Srinivasan. Thank you, Kapil. We will now open the floor for Q&A session. We have first question from the line of Sandeep Shah from Equirus Securities.

<a id="post-58"></a>
[58] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: Thanks, Pratik. Thanks Asha.

<a id="post-59"></a>
[59] **Sandeep Shah** Sandeep Shah: Congratulations on a great execution, both on revenue margin as well as employee addition. Just the first question, sir, is there a seasonality in the ACV booking from Q4 to Q1? Though on YoY, we have done well, but do you believe the decline QoQ is seasonal and may continue in future? Or there are some delayed decision making?

<a id="post-60"></a>
[60] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: Sandeep, thanks for the question. As I had mentioned in the last quarter as well, QoQ there will always be some amount of volatility up or down. If you look at full year ACV of last year, we did roughly about $140 million. We expect to do higher than that on a full year basis.

<a id="post-61"></a>
[61] **Sandeep Shah** Sandeep Shah: Also, some commentary about roll-off, it continues at the scale of 15%, 20% of the top line?

<a id="post-62"></a>
[62] **Srinivasan Nadadhur** Srinivasan Nadadhur: Yes, about the same, there is no significant change in roll-off percentages.

<a id="post-63"></a>
[63] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: Thank you, Pratik, and good evening, everyone. We are pleased to share the highlights of our performance in FY26 Q1. It was a good quarter on both the revenue and margin fronts. Operating revenue for Q1 was USD 109.2 million, up 4.2% sequentially and 17.1% YoY. In INR terms, Q1 operating revenue was INR 9,346 million, up 4% sequentially and 19.5% YoY. Margins came in stronger as well, despite the impact of the annual wage increase, which we see in Q1. EBITDA for Q1 was INR 2,346 million at a margin of 24.8%, down 6.3% sequentially, but up 25.3% YoY. PAT for the quarter was INR 1,417 million at a margin of 15%, down 6.9% sequentially, but up nearly 27% YoY. Our deal wins were at $32 million for Q1. We are happy to note that Analytics and Automation went up 6% over the previous quarter, stronger than the firm growth rate and that emerging client growth has outpaced top 10 client growth. Growth has been broad-based across all our verticals, other than Fashion and Luxury segment. On the new centers, we have recently opened our Lima operations, which went live this quarter, and operations in Cairo will be going live in Q2.

<a id="post-64"></a>
[64] **Sandeep Shah** Sandeep Shah: Okay. And last few things. In terms of employee addition being robust, so that implies we also have a healthy growth visibility at least in the near term. Is it the right way of looking at it?

<a id="post-65"></a>
[65] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: Yes. Sandeep, I think we do see client demand and the overall strategy that we have laid out for the company is working well in terms of service line capabilities and the verticals that we have created.

<a id="post-66"></a>
[66] **Sandeep Shah** Sandeep Shah: Okay and just last 2 questions, Srini, generally, Q1 margin is lower for wage hikes. But if we compare the full year margin versus Q1 margin, it improves by 3% to 4% points. So, in this scenario, do you believe this time we could be near the upper end of the comfort guidance of 24%, 28% in this year?

<a id="post-67"></a>
[67] **Srinivasan Nadadhur** Srinivasan Nadadhur: We don't know. The year has just started, and it's possible that we may want to invest more in the business if we see margins trending up. So, I mean that is the decision that Kapil and the executive team will take during the course of the year.

<a id="post-68"></a>
[68] **Sandeep Shah** Sandeep Shah: Okay. And the last question, last year the buyback was concluded in the second quarter. So, when we come out with the Q2 results, mandatory period of 12 months would have been completed. So, in a fair scenario, one can expect the buyback can be considered by the Board in the near to medium term?

<a id="post-69"></a>
[69] **Srinivasan Nadadhur** Srinivasan Nadadhur: It's possible, yes.

<a id="post-70"></a>
[70] **Pratik Jagtap** Pratik Jagtap: Thank you, Sandeep. We have next question from the line of Mihir Manohar from Carnelian Capital.

<a id="post-71"></a>
[71] **Mihir Manohar** Mihir Manohar: Congratulations on the great set of numbers. Largely wanted to understand on the margin side. Generally, 1Q is a period where we have 200 or 300 basis points kind of drop in margins. But however, this time that is not the case. If you could quantify the headwinds and tailwinds for margin on a QoQ basis for this quarter, that would be helpful.

<a id="post-72"></a>
[72] **Srinivasan Nadadhur** Srinivasan Nadadhur: Yes. So roughly about 250 bps has come through because of wage hikes, and about 20 has come because of the new delivery centers that we have opened. On that, we were able to recoup margin because of the strong growth, especially offshore and as I mentioned, when the growth happens in a couple of our areas like BFSI and CMT, we are able to replace at the bottom of the pyramid, which results in the overall wage cost going down.

<a id="post-73"></a>
[73] **Mihir Manohar** Mihir Manohar: Understood, sure. Second question was on the DSO side. I mean, you mentioned systems and processes, some change in some of the clients. What is this change exactly? And for what part of the business is this change happening? And will we revert back to our original number?

<a id="post-74"></a>
[74] **Kapil Jain** I would like to share some commentary and outlook about our businesses. On BFSI, clients in that segment have reported strong results on the back of high volatility. There are broad opportunities across large and small clients, both new and existing. We are working on several interesting KYC client onboarding opportunities with new clients as well as expansion of existing clients. These opportunities are a mix of tech, data and operations.

<a id="post-75"></a>
[75] **Srinivasan Nadadhur** Srinivasan Nadadhur: So, some of our clients want to change the processes and their internal system that they use for tracking purchase orders. While they are migrating to the new system, some of our invoices are on hold. This is in a couple of our BFSI clients and a couple of our Retail and Emerging clients. And DSO, you want to talk about it?

<a id="post-76"></a>
[76] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: Yes. I think definitely this year, the DSO moved from 80 to 86. We do expect it to bring in line with what it has been on average in the previous quarters between 80 and 82.

<a id="post-77"></a>
[77] **Mihir Manohar** eClerx Services Limited Understood, sure. Third question was just on the GitHub Copilot. So, what number of people are broadly we trying to train on GitHub Copilot and trying to drive productivity?

<a id="post-78"></a>
[78] **Srinivasan Nadadhur** Srinivasan Nadadhur: The Technology team is about 1,700. So, I would expect that maybe about half of them will be doing pure technology work and the other half may be doing analytics kind of work. So rough assumption is about 60%.

<a id="post-79"></a>
[79] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: Also, I think the work that we do on the technology side, broadly, we classify in services that we are rendering on top of our IP and there our technology team that's working on the same. If they are able to get trained on GitHub, you can realize the productivity immediately, because that's something on our infrastructure, on-prem, and we are able to realize the productivity. Technology folks that are working on client systems where we are delivering services of the client systems or we are providing low-code/no-code or doing tech work. There even if we are trained to apply that productivity is a function of clients' infrastructure, security and other parameters. So, I would take 25% of 60% of 1,700 as the number. Immediately, I think what we are looking at is people who are working on the back of our IP, that's something is, yes, we will see benefits as we move along.

<a id="post-80"></a>
[80] **Mihir Manohar** Mihir Manohar: Understood, sure. And lastly, on the margins on Analytics division, does Analytics have higher margin for us versus the company average?

<a id="post-81"></a>
[81] **Srinivasan Nadadhur** Srinivasan Nadadhur: At a gross margin level, the percentage gross margin is lower, but the dollar gross margin is higher.

<a id="post-82"></a>
[82] **Pratik Jagtap** Pratik Jagtap: Thank you Mihir. The next question is from the line of Dipesh Mehta from Emkay Global.

<a id="post-83"></a>
[83] **Dipesh Mehta** Dipesh Mehta Two questions from my side. First about the Emerging client revenue, if I look at it, after relative softness for previous quarter, largely because of Fashion and Luxury related and digital spend where you indicated some softness. But this quarter, it bounced back. While your commentary remained largely similar around that Fashion segment. So, if you can provide what is driving growth in Emerging client this quarter? That is question one. And how do you expect that momentum to continue in coming quarter? Second question is about sales and distribution. Partly you indicated about the reclassification, but even adjusted for reclassification it is down. So, if you can provide some sense how one should look at the sales and distribution investment going forward?

<a id="post-84"></a>
[84] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: I think growth in Emerging clients is a function of a few things. One is average deal size going up, our ability to sell more services to our existing set of clients, cross-sell, upsell that I spoke about. In terms of high-end Fashion and Retail, I think what you're seeing margins is on account of the constant currency, I think we still are cautious on that segment of business. And what was your last question?

<a id="post-85"></a>
[85] **Kapil Jain** On the Fashion and Luxury [segment], there has been no change in the outlook from the previous quarter. This segment continues to remain weak with U.S. market underperforming, weakness in China and appreciation of the euro. Both Hi-Tech and M&D and our Emerging businesses grew strongly in the last quarter, and the outlook remains broadly positive. Our Market Intelligence platform and tech services are resonating well with clients.

<a id="post-86"></a>
[86] **Dipesh Mehta** Dipesh Mehta: Sir, sales and distribution even adjusted for reclassification is down, when I look sequentially as well as YoY perspective. So how one should look at it as a percentage of revenue going forward?

<a id="post-87"></a>
[87] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: I won't look at QoQ like I said, we will continue to let go of the bottom performers, continue to hire at the top end, continue to hire where we see growth momentum either across service lines, vertical, geos. So, I wouldn't look at a trend line QoQ. On a yearly basis, we should be around the number that we had last year.

<a id="post-88"></a>
[88] **Dipesh Mehta** Dipesh Mehta: Understood. And last question is about overall demand scenario perspective. Let's say, from the beginning of year, considering the way deal pipeline shape up happened as well as quarter 1 performance, are we more confident about growth acceleration or you think things are largely stable? So, if you can provide some context compared to where we started versus now?

<a id="post-89"></a>
[89] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: We are cautiously optimistic, Dipesh, in terms of what we are seeing. Like I said, our overall strategy is working well in terms of cross-sell, upsell, as well as in the financial services space, compliance, KYC seems to resonate well. We have recently been acknowledged by Everest on the Peak Metrics. I think all these things definitely are the tailwinds that we have. But overall macroeconomic environment continues to be volatile and hence, we are cautiously optimistic.

<a id="post-90"></a>
[90] **Pratik Jagtap** Pratik Jagtap: Thank you, Dipesh. We have next question from the line of Shradha Agrawal from AMSEC.

<a id="post-91"></a>
[91] **Shradha Agrawal** Shradha Agrawal: Congratulations on another great quarter. Two questions. Last quarter you had indicated that the pipeline for FY26 looks better than what it was at the beginning of FY25. So, with strong conversions coming through this quarter also, do we still have a stronger pipeline compared to what it was at the end of FY25?

<a id="post-92"></a>
[92] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: Yes, Shradha, pipeline continues to be strong. As I was mentioning that our deal sizes have gone up, which is taking longer from a conversion point of view, which is why Q1 you saw a decline over Q4. But YoY there is a growth. And like I said, that on the ACV basis for the full year, we do expect to do higher than what we did in FY25.

<a id="post-93"></a>
[93] **Shradha Agrawal** Shradha Agrawal: Right and in terms of GCC, IT companies at least have specific GCC approach now, and they have carved out business units to focus on GCC as a focus area. So, what is our strategy around GCC? Are we doing anything different now compared to what historically we have done around that space?

<a id="post-94"></a>
[94] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: So, Shradha, we have been working with GCCs from the very beginning. I think every client we work with has a GCC in the financial services sector. So, for us this is an opportunity, and we have a dedicated team as well. I think it's just doubling down on what we were already doing to capture market share from the GCCs.

<a id="post-95"></a>
[95] **Shradha Agrawal** Shradha Agrawal: Sir, last question, what drove a very strong growth in our Analytics and Automation practice this quarter?

<a id="post-96"></a>
[96] **Kapil Jain** On Communication, Media and Telecom, we see good traction on both new logo wins and in cross-sell of CX services, omnichannel services that we provide. We will leverage the new delivery centers to grow footprint with both existing and new clients. Clients continue to remain focused on cost control and operational efficiencies.

<a id="post-97"></a>
[97] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: There were a couple of things. One is, again, on the Analytics, MarTech, and some of the other capabilities that we have, our ability to cross-sell, upsell that into a wider set of clients. Second is we have made a structural change to bring Analytics and Technology under one umbrella. So that was other reason. So, we are able to bring in a more synergistic view for the clients across Data Engineering, Analytics, Insights. And it's broad-based across capital markets, financial services clients, hi-tech and customer operations.

<a id="post-98"></a>
[98] **Shradha Agrawal** Shradha Agrawal: Right. And sir, last question, I know you had not commented on revenue growth guidance for FY26, but you had indicated that the deal ACV number would be higher. But given how we've started off the year, and given the kind of hiring momentum that has happened in the quarter, would you be comfortable in saying that on the revenue growth as well, FY26 could be better than FY25?

<a id="post-99"></a>
[99] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: Shradha, I won't comment on that. I think what I can say is because, as I said, there are a lot of macroeconomic uncertainties that we are living in. Definitely, [in] Q2, we are confident of showing sequential growth over Q1 and then we will give the further guidance as and when we meet in the Q2 earnings call.

<a id="post-100"></a>
[100] **Pratik Jagtap** Pratik Jagtap: Thank you, Shradha. We have next question from the line of Vikal Gupta an Individual Investor.

<a id="post-101"></a>
[101] **Vikal Gupta** Vikal Gupta: Congratulations for yet another fantastic quarter. So, my question is, when the results are coming so fantastic, don't you think that are looking for revising the guidelines to the upside? Or is it too early to comment on that? And the second question is, in the near future can we see that consideration for the bonus share?

<a id="post-102"></a>
[102] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: Yes, so I'll take the first question, and let Srini answer on the bonus share. As I said, we don't give guidance for the future. What we have indicated is that pipeline is robust. We have seen sequential growth in Q1. And Q2 we are reasonably confident to deliver sequential growth. The margin guidance we continue to maintain between 24% to 28%, despite opening up 2 new centers, one in Cairo, one in Peru. And as you know, when you are opening a new center, it takes time to break even. So, I think we are not going to change the guidance on our EBITDA and margin front, and sequential increase in EBITDA is what we have said. So, I'm continuing to maintain the same guidance.

<a id="post-103"></a>
[103] **Srinivasan Nadadhur** Srinivasan Nadadhur: eClerx Services Limited July 25, 2025 9 On the bonus, it is something for the Board to decide. And we are, of course, cognizant of the fact that we want more retail investors to participate, and therefore, we would like for the share price at least from a psychological standpoint to be in a certain low range where people can actively trade. And therefore, when the time is right, we will propose it to the Board, and I'm sure the Board in their wisdom will take the right decision.

<a id="post-104"></a>
[104] **Vikal Gupta** Vikal Gupta: And my main idea was request for the bonus share for making more availability in the market and the liquidity for the retail shareholders.

<a id="post-105"></a>
[105] **Pratik Jagtap** Pratik Jagtap Thank you, Vikal. We have the next question from the line of Girish Pai from BOB Capital Markets.

<a id="post-106"></a>
[106] **Girish Pai** Girish Pai: One of the running themes in this result season has been vendor consolidation that most companies have been talking about. What has been your experience with regard to that?

<a id="post-107"></a>
[107] **Kapil Jain** On Technology and Analytics services did well in Q1. We see interest in our productized services offerings around compliance, compliance manager, market intelligence and in low-code/no-code services.

<a id="post-108"></a>
[108] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: Yes, we have seen vendor consolidation and in larger clients where, as I had mentioned that our delivery continues to be strong, backed by productized services and technology. So, if anything, we have benefited from the consolidation in the industry.

<a id="post-109"></a>
[109] **Girish Pai** Girish Pai: Okay. Can you give us an outlook vis-a-vis verticals and the service lines that you have, especially Retail and the Consumer-oriented side of the business, how is that kind of working?

<a id="post-110"></a>
[110] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: Sorry, I said that the growth this quarter, except the high-end Fashion and Retail, was broad-based. On Financial Services, we see healthy demand and outlook, and so is also true on the Communication, Media ad Telecom. Hi-tech and M&D also we see a growth in Q1 and as well as in Emerging markets. So, except for high-end Fashion and Retail where we are still seeing some headwinds, which I mentioned in my opening remarks, we see positive momentum across all of the 4 verticals.

<a id="post-111"></a>
[111] **Girish Pai** Girish Pai: Any outlook on how order inflow is going to look like in the coming quarters?

<a id="post-112"></a>
[112] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: The ACV as I said, QoQ, is a little difficult in terms of the timelines. What I'm saying is that we are reasonably confident to close the year higher than what we closed our ACV in FY25.

<a id="post-113"></a>
[113] **Girish Pai** Girish Pai: Between H1 and H2, which will be a stronger half?

<a id="post-114"></a>
[114] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: I'm hoping that H2 should be stronger than H1. But like I said, there is a lot of overall macroeconomic

<a id="post-115"></a>
[115] **Kapil Jain** eClerx Services Limited July 25, 2025 10 uncertainty, which we are living under. We will give you a better outlook when we meet in Q2 earnings call. I have already mentioned about Q2.

<a id="post-116"></a>
[116] **Pratik Jagtap** Pratik Jagtap: Thank you, Girish. We have the next question from the line of Rehan Saiyyed from Trinetra Asset Managers.

<a id="post-117"></a>
[117] **Rehan Saiyyed** Rehan Saiyyed: As most of the questions were already answered, so I am left with 1 or 2. Yes. So, my first question is regarding this, sir, can you share an update on new client wins in North America and Europe and the pipeline visibility from these geographies? If you could please put some light on this?

<a id="post-118"></a>
[118] **Kapil Jain** I'll now cover some of the brief awards and recognitions that we have received this quarter. We have been included in the Leaders Quadrant of Everest Group's Financial Crime and Compliance Operations Services Peak Matrix Assessment 2025, a recognition that demonstrates our commitment to delivering innovative and effective compliance solutions to our clients.

<a id="post-119"></a>
[119] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: Rehan, we don't give client names. As I said, our pipeline is robust across U.S. and Europe, and across verticals that I just mentioned, and pipeline remains healthy.

<a id="post-120"></a>
[120] **Rehan Saiyyed** Rehan Saiyyed: Okay. So you have tell that majority of your client concentration coming from the U.S. and Europe markets, right? Am I right, sir?

<a id="post-121"></a>
[121] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: That's correct.

<a id="post-122"></a>
[122] **Rehan Saiyyed** Rehan Saiyyed: My second question is on the Capex side, sir, what was the Capex plan for this upcoming year going forward? Could you just mention the numbers?

<a id="post-123"></a>
[123] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: Srini will you take that?

<a id="post-124"></a>
[124] **Srinivasan Nadadhur** Srinivasan Nadadhur: Number we don't usually mention, but our Capex is led by demand. So, demand for facilities and demand for computing equipment. So, to the extent that we see growth in the business, the Capex will follow.

<a id="post-125"></a>
[125] **Pratik Jagtap** Pratik Jagtap: Thank you, Rehan. We have the next question from the line of Jalaj from SVAN Investments.

<a id="post-126"></a>
[126] **Jalaj Manocha** Jalaj Manocha: First of all, congrats on a great set of numbers. So sir, I had a few set of questions. First question was around AI, the general discussions around it. What verticals or service lines are supporting us in terms of the offerings? And where is it impacting us negatively? Because there is a lot of noise around BPM businesses being negatively impacted by AI, because the operational work is getting replaced. So how are we using it to our favor? Could you put some light around it?

<a id="post-127"></a>
[127] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: Okay. So Jalaj, as I had mentioned that the productized services that we provide, which are on our IP, for example, compliance manager in the KYC space, we are extensively using Gen AI for client outreach, entity summarization, and some of the other functionality that we provide. On the quality audit function that we provide on the Care side, we are using Gen AI for speech to text, sentiment analysis, and providing insights. The insights that we provide, our clients are using it to drive elimination and automation and because of our superior delivery, we are net gainer in terms of the overall top line, right, in terms of the numbers. Also we are also looking at passing on the some of the benefits that we are getting in terms of the work that we are doing by bringing in GenAI, Agentic AI into the products that we use to deliver the services, some of those benefits we are passing on to the clients.

<a id="post-128"></a>
[128] **Kapil Jain** In terms of Agentic AI, we are leveraging our Roboworx platform that we have, where we have integrated our Agentic AI framework, and we are building on top of the entire ecosystem that we have. We are using it as an opportunity because we understand the domain. We have underlying technology, our IP on which we are delivering services, and we have the process knowledge. So, if you bring it all together, I think it's an opportunity for us and yes, industry is there, but those are like traditionally the models which has gone on a seat model. But I think the services that we are providing is an integrated offering across tech, domain and process.

<a id="post-129"></a>
[129] **Kapil Jain** eClerx Chief Technology Officer, Sanjay Kukreja, has been honored as the Evangelist 100 by the Chief Security Officer Award, CSO100 by Foundry and IDG Inc. Company for his outstanding leadership in driving technology transformation and fortifying cybersecurity strategy. eClerx has also been honored with the prestigious Financial Express CFO Award, FE CFO, in the Medium Enterprises Services segment, underscoring the company's commitment to financial discipline, risk management, sustainable growth and having the highest set of corporate governance.

<a id="post-130"></a>
[130] **Jalaj Manocha** Jalaj Manocha: Understood. Makes sense. Fine, sir. That answers it. My second question was around, if I look at the Europe numbers quarterly, there was some abrupt fall last quarter, and it has recouped now. So, I'm talking about the run rate. It is running in $16 million quarterly run rate in the Europe geography. It had gone to $14 million levels, and now it is back. So, were there some changes we did? Or was it a oneoff? How should we understand what is the reason behind it?

<a id="post-131"></a>
[131] **Srinivasan Nadadhur** Srinivasan Nadadhur: There is a reduction in CLX in Europe. So, most of our European revenue is based on CLX. Are you looking at euro numbers or are you looking at USD figures for the Europe geography? Jalaj Manocha:

<a id="post-132"></a>
[132] **Jalaj Manocha** I'm looking at the USD numbers.

<a id="post-133"></a>
[133] **Srinivasan Nadadhur** Srinivasan Nadadhur: So then that is the effect of the currency depreciation of the USD against the euro. So, if you look at constant currency numbers, I don't know whether you'll be able to work that out, but Europe is largely flat for us and that is largely driven because of this weakness in the CLX business.

<a id="post-134"></a>
[134] **Jalaj Manocha** Jalaj Manocha: Okay. So, any plans or any focus area specifically on the Europe geography?

<a id="post-135"></a>
[135] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: Yes. In terms of U.K. and Continental Europe, we do have plans to invest in sales hunting capability. And as and when we find the right leadership, we will continue to invest in Continental Europe and U.K.

<a id="post-136"></a>
[136] **Jalaj Manocha** Jalaj Manocha: Okay and verticals would still continue to be same?

<a id="post-137"></a>
[137] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: Yes.

<a id="post-138"></a>
[138] **Jalaj Manocha** Jalaj Manocha: Got it. And sir, my last question was around specifically BFSI. So we were talking about predominantly, we have been working in B2B so far, a flavor of it. So, there were some discussions that we were trying to get into B2C vertical of the banking. And specifically, it looks like the numbers have been very strong, the growth numbers in banking. So could you put in some flavor from where has the growth come in? And has there been something we have been able to crack on the B2C part also of the business?

<a id="post-139"></a>
[139] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: So, the growth, I would say, predominantly has come from the institutional side, which is B2B. However, we have made some inroads and success on the consumer side as well on B2C in certain areas. We do hope to continue our focus on the consumer side as well.

<a id="post-140"></a>
[140] **Kapil Jain** As many of you know, learning and development forms the foundation of our delivery model. Six months ago, we introduced a cutting-edge Gen AI training course in collaboration with the Technical University of Munich, one of the world's top universities in computer science and engineering. I am proud to share that as a result of this initiative, 8,000 employees have successfully upskilled, which represents roughly 40% of our employee count. We are also upskilling the entire technology team on GitHub Copilot in line with our CTO's vision to drive 25% productivity gain by leveraging AI code generation tools.

<a id="post-141"></a>
[141] **Jalaj Manocha** Jalaj Manocha: So currently, it's not a sizable part.

<a id="post-142"></a>
[142] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: As the overall size of the business, you're right. But I think it's good to see that we have had some success on the consumer side of the banking as well.

<a id="post-143"></a>
[143] **Jalaj Manocha** Jalaj Manocha: Got it. And just an extension of you also been mentioning one part of banking, banks reporting better numbers because of the volatility in the markets. So, what attribution of our growth would go to or would be due to the volatility in the markets? Because I understand that we do a lot of processing of back-end derivatives also as a part of our offering. Has that also been helping the growth in our banking vertical or something else?

<a id="post-144"></a>
[144] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: Yes. Some of it is attributed to the growth in the volatility that we have seen. But I think I would only ascribe a small percentage to that.

<a id="post-145"></a>
[145] **Pratik Jagtap** Pratik Jagtap: Thank you, Jalaj. We have a follow-up question from the line of Sandeep Shah from Equirus Securities.

<a id="post-146"></a>
[146] **Sandeep Shah** Sandeep Shah: Kapil, just your qualitative and expert view regarding Capgemini announcing acquisition of WNS, especially during times where people have a concern that BPM can be impacted more through GenAI and Agentic AI. So, do you believe what has driven this? And second, do you believe this may create a competitive pressure, may not be near term, but in the next 3 to 5 years?

<a id="post-147"></a>
[147] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: I think Sandeep, I would suggest the best people to answer this question is Capgemini who has acquired WNS. And only time will tell. I have told you our strategy, how we are using GenAI, Agentic AI, and how we are able to bring in technology domain and process layer altogether. I wouldn't want to comment on the competition.

<a id="post-148"></a>
[148] **Sandeep Shah** Sandeep Shah: Okay. And just a second question, when you apply the Gen AI or Agentic AI in customer live projects, how the budget shapes up post that for you as a particular vendor with that client? Does that lead to better outsourcing because of the saving in other areas or how to look at it this as a whole budget within the client once you execute the GenAI and Agentic AI?

<a id="post-149"></a>
[149] **Kapil Jain** Kapil Jain: What I'm saying is that the products that we have, which we are leveraging to deliver services to our clients, we are enabling them GenAI and also now Agentic AI, right? So there, as I was telling you, it's on-prem on our infra, and I'm able to deploy Gen AI, Agentic AI and get the benefit and pass some of that benefit to the clients. It is helping, a, both on the efficiency side as well as effectiveness side because that's allowing me to deliver a better outcome for the clients because my agent is now able to focus in enhancing the overall experience as opposed to looking at data and bringing data together. Because lot of traditional tasks we are using our productized tools and which are enabled by Gen AI. So those are the 2 reasons which are helping us both, enhance the experience, efficiency and effectiveness.

<a id="post-150"></a>
[150] **Sandeep Shah** Sandeep Shah: Okay. And just last thing on a lighter note, sir. When you are cautiously optimistic, you are delivering mid-teens or higher growth. So once macro recover, I think Street may expect more than 20% growth. All the best.

### Round 1

<a id="post-151"></a>
[151] **Delivery Center Director, APAC** [Risk] Launching Lima and Cairo could extend elevated DSO because new legal entities require client vendor-master setup, tax/withholding validation, and PO policy mapping; when combined with clients’ ongoing system migrations, invoices can be held longer despite delivery ramp. | Falsifier: DSO back to 80–82 by Q2 {Conf: Med} _(🔄 9)_

[156] **Institutional Investor Relations Specialist** [Risk] Expectation-management gap emerging: mgmt signals Q2 QoQ growth, higher FY26 ACV, and “possible” buyback while cash conversion fell (DSO 86) and ACV cycles are lengthening. Mechanism: If ERP-driven DSO slippage persists, OCF constrains capital return, and larger ACV converts slower, driving sentiment whiplash.

[161] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of July 2025, do Egypt and Peru have EU GDPR adequacy decisions, and what transfer mechanisms does the European Commission recommend for data transfers to these jurisdictions? A: Short answer: No. As of July 2025 the European Commission has not adopted adequacy decisions for Egypt or for Peru. ([commission.europa.eu](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Recommended transfer mechanisms: in the absence of an adequacy decision the EU framework requires “appropriate safeguards” under Article 46 GDPR — e.g. the Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs), approved codes of conduct or certification mechanisms — or, where those do not apply, narrow Article 49 derogations. Transfers may also require supplementary technical/organizational/legal measures depending on access by public authorities. ([edpb.europa.eu](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/node/5440_mt?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [edps.europa.eu](https://www.edps.europa.eu/data-protection/data-protection/reference-library/international-transfers_en?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can (a) pull the Commission’s current adequacy list snapshot for a specific July‑2025 date, or (b) list practical supplementary measures organisations typically use.

[162] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What was eClerx’s operating cash flow to EBITDA conversion percentage in Q2 FY26? A: As of Aug 15, 2025 eClerx has not yet released Q2 FY26 (quarter ended Sep 30, 2025) results, so the operating‑cash‑flow‑to‑EBITDA conversion for Q2 FY26 is not available. The latest reported quarter (Q1 FY26) showed an OCF‑to‑EBITDA conversion of 9.5%.

A: Short answer: I could not find any publicly posted ISO certificate numbers, issuing bodies, formal scope statements, or SOC 2 reports (or their validity dates) that explicitly name eClerx’s Cairo (Egypt) or Lima (Peru) delivery centres. eClerx publicly states ISO/IEC 27001 compliance and lists new Lima/Cairo centres (2025), but certificate documents and SOC 2 reports are not published on the website—SOC 2 reports are typically restricted and provided to customers under NDA. ([eclerx.com](https://eclerx.com/privacy-policy/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [markets.financialcontent.com](https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/bizwire-2025-4-24-eclerx-expands-global-footprint-with-new-delivery-center-in-lima-peru?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [aicpa.com](https://www.aicpa.com/topic/audit-assurance/audit-and-assurance-greater-than-soc-2?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you need authoritative copies (certificate PDFs with numbers/scope/validity or a SOC 2 that includes Cairo/Lima), ask eClerx’s compliance/DPO (DPO@eclerx.com) or request the redacted report under NDA; they are the definitive source.

[164] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: Provide the publication dates and public links or regulatory references for eClerx’s EU standard contractual clauses, any binding corporate rules approvals, and transfer impact assessments that cover transfers from the EU/UK to Egypt and Peru for the Cairo and Lima delivery centers. A: Checked 15 Aug 2025. - eClerx: its public privacy/DPA materials state it relies on “EU‑approved standard contractual clauses” for transfers (no company‑specific SCC text published). See eClerx privacy notice (DPO contact: DPO@eclerx.com). ([eclerx.com](https://eclerx.com/privacy-policy/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - EU SCCs (publication): Commission Implementing Decision on the new SCCs adopted 4 Jun 2021 (OJ L199, 7 Jun 2021; entered into force 27 Jun 2021).

[165] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: List the specific licenses or approvals required under Egypt’s Personal Data Protection Law and Central Bank of Egypt outsourcing regulations, and under Peru’s Superintendency of Banking, Insurance and AFPs (SBS) outsourcing rules, to perform cross-border BFSI/KYC processing; provide any public documentation from eClerx showing these licenses for its Cairo and Lima centers. A: Short answer — required approvals and what I found from eClerx: - Egypt: under PDPL (Law No.151/2020) cross‑border transfers require a prior licence/permit from the Personal Data Protection Centre (PDPC); controllers/processors must obtain applicable PDPL licences/registrations. Separately, CBE‑regulated entities must use outsourcing providers that are registered with/acceptable to the Central Bank (outsourcing/"delegated services" registration/contractual requirements). ([iclg.com](https://iclg.com/practice-areas/data-protection-laws-and-regulations/egypt?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [resourcehub.bakermckenzie.com](https://resourcehub.bakermckenzie.com/en/resources/cloud-compliance-center/emea/egypt/topics/rules-for-cloud-outsourcing?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Peru: SBS rules (Reg. SBS Nº504‑2021 / Reg. 272‑2017) require (a) firms to notify SBS 30 days before significant third‑party data‑processing (including cloud) and (b) to obtain SBS authorization before contracting significant cross‑border processing when the service cannot meet Article 24 requirements; SBS also prescribes evidence (ISO27001/27017/27018, SOC2 or equivalent) and contractual/audit access. ([busquedas.elperuano.pe](https://busquedas.elperuano.pe/api/visor_html/1929393-1)) - eClerx public docs: eClerx announced new Cairo and Lima delivery centres and publishes a privacy/compliance page, but I found no public copies of PDPC, CBE registration or SBS authorisations on eClerx’s site or press materials — you should request attestations (PDPC/CBE/SBS approval letters or local‑entity registrations and SOC/ISO reports) directly from eClerx (DPO/contact).

[166] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: Which luxury sector client wins for CX or KYC services originating from eClerx’s Cairo or Lima centers have been publicly disclosed in FY26 to date, including client names (if public), scope of work, and ACV or TCV? A: Short answer: I could not find any publicly disclosed FY26 luxury‑sector client wins for CX or KYC work that specifically originate from eClerx’s Lima or Cairo centres (no client names, scopes, or ACV/TCV announced to date). eClerx’s Q1 FY26 disclosures note the Lima/Cairo openings and say they’re pursuing KYC opportunities (mainly in BFSI) and that Fashion & Luxury remained weak, but they did not announce any named luxury CX/KYC deals or contract values.

[167] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) did eClerx report for Q2 FY26, and how does it compare with the company’s historical 80–82 day range? A: As of Aug 15, 2025 eClerx has not yet published Q2 FY26 (quarter ended Sept 30, 2025) results, so no official Q2 FY26 DSO is available. For context, eClerx reported DSO = 86 days in Q1 FY26 (up from 80 days), which is above the company’s typical ~80–82‑day range (management said they expect DSO to revert to ~80–82 days).

A: Short answer: I could not find any publicly available third‑party social/labor certification or audit report (SA8000, SMETA or client social‑audit) specifically for eClerx’s Cairo delivery centre in 2025. What I checked: - eClerx announcement that the Cairo delivery centre opened / went live in Q2 2025. ([marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ECLERX-SERVICES-LIMITED-9059903/news/EClerx-Expands-Global-Outreach-with-New-Delivery-Center-in-Cairo-Egypt-50189466/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [zonebourse.com](https://www.zonebourse.com/cours/action/ECLERX-SERVICES-LIMITED-9059903/actualite/Transcript-EClerx-Services-Limited-Q1-2026-Earnings-Call-Jul-25-2025-50615656/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Public registries/standards pages where SA8000 or SMETA audits are listed (no Cairo eClerx audit record located in searches).

A: Short answer — published eClerx/Roboworx materials (FY25–FY26 timeframe) that quantify SLA/QA impact: - Compliance Manager — eClerx case study reports faster deployment (platform live in ~6 weeks) and product claims up to 60% automation of KYC data sourcing (≈35% cost reduction). ([technology.eclerx.com](https://technology.eclerx.com/transforming-client-lifecycle-management-with-eclerx-compliance-manager/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [ecmmarkets.eclerx.com](https://ecmmarkets.eclerx.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - QA360 — eClerx product page / collateral cites 100% audit coverage (automated audits) and a ~35% agent‑performance improvement (and eClerx posts cite reductions in compliance incidents ~40%).

[170] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What percentage of eClerx’s H1 FY26 new deal annual contract value was outcome-priced or IP-led versus FTE-based, and how did this mix compare to FY25? A: Short answer: I can’t — H1 FY26 (Apr–Sep 2025) hadn’t completed and eClerx had not published H1 FY26 results as of Aug 15, 2025. The latest published comparator is FY25: eClerx’s FY25 investor slides show BPaaS (outcome‑priced) + Analytics & Automation (IP‑led) ACV ≈ $22.1m + $19.0m = $41.1m of total new‑deal ACV $91.2m — roughly 45% outcome‑priced/IP‑led vs ~55% FTE‑based (FY25). I derived the split by summing the BPaaS and A&A lines on the FY25 slides. If you want, I can recheck once eClerx files H1 FY26 (after Sep 30, 2025).

[171] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What was the amount of the one-time gratuity fund contribution recorded by eClerx in Q1 FY26, and by how much did it reduce operating cash flow in the quarter? A: Short answer: eClerx did not disclose the exact rupee amount of the one‑time gratuity‑fund contribution. Management said a “large” one‑time contribution (together with higher DSO) materially lowered net operating cash flow, which came in at INR 223 million in Q1 FY26 — but the company did not break out how many rupees of the INR 223m was due solely to the gratuity payment.

[172] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What public disclosures has eClerx made in FY26 regarding cash balances in Egypt and Peru and the ability to convert and repatriate USD from these markets, including whether repatriations were unrestricted for two consecutive quarters? A: Short answer: In FY26 eClerx publicly announced new delivery centres in Lima (Peru) and Cairo (Egypt) and reported Q1 FY26 results (quarter ended June 30, 2025), but I could not find any FY26 public filing, press release, earnings‑call transcript or investor presentation that discloses specific cash balances held in Egypt or Peru or that states USD held there were convertible/repatriable (or that repatriations were “unrestricted for two consecutive quarters”).

### Round 2

<a id="post-174"></a>
[174] **Delivery Center Director, APAC** Has eClerx publicly posted updated ISO 27001 certificate scope and SOC 2 (Type II) reports that include the Cairo (Egypt) and Lima (Peru) delivery centers, and if so, what are the issue dates and scope boundaries? _(🔄 10)_

<a id="post-175"></a>
[175] **ESG Investment Analyst** [Strength] Compliance/controls moat forming: Everest Leaders Quadrant (Financial Crime & Compliance Ops), 8,000 staff GenAI upskilled via TUM, and QA/agentic tooling in KYC/CX together improve auditability, lower conduct risk, and increase switching costs amid vendor consolidation—supporting stickier BFSI growth and margin resilience. CSO100 and FE CFO awards signal governance rigor. [Status: INCONCLUSIVE] impact magnitude. | Falsifier: Everest downgrade; client FCC audit flags major gaps {Conf: Med} _(🔄 2)_

<a id="post-176"></a>
[176] **Quantitative Macro Strategist** Has eClerx disclosed FY26 revenue/cost currency mix (USD/EUR/GBP vs INR/EGP/PEN), hedge coverage/tenor, and EBITDA sensitivity to 1% INR/EUR/GBP moves, plus any Egypt/Peru local-currency cash/repatriation practices in filings or presentations? _(🔄 10)_

<a id="post-177"></a>
[177] **Client-side IT Transformation Lead** [Strength] Margin resilience looks structural: Q1 offset wage hikes by pyramiding talent offshore (BFSI/CMT) while 8,000 staff GenAI‑upskilled and ~60% of tech targeted for Copilot training expand output per head, enabling larger ACVs to be executed without proportional headcount growth. | Falsifier: Revenue/FTE and utilization don’t improve in H2 {Conf: Med} _(🔄 1)_

<a id="post-178"></a>
[178] **Emerging Markets Regulator** [Risk] EU AI Act bans workplace “emotion recognition”; eClerx’s QA use of speech-to-text + sentiment analytics for agent quality could be construed as emotion recognition if applied to EU workforces, compelling feature disablement, redesign, or fines—slowing EU CX ramp via Cairo/Lima. [Status: INCONCLUSIVE] | Falsifier: EU-specific configs exclude emotion features or counsel memo {Conf: Med}

<a id="post-179"></a>
[179] **Institutional Investor Relations Specialist** [Strength] Management’s AI execution narrative is unusually concrete for BPM—8,000 staff GenAI‑trained (with TUM), targeted Copilot rollout to ~60% of 1,700 tech, and immediate productivity capture on IP‑hosted delivery. Mechanism: credible, scoped adoption supports win‑rates and cushions margins, narrowing the “AI disruption” discount in investor models. | Falsifier: no IP-delivery productivity/pricing gains by Q4 {Conf: Med} _(🔄 2)_

<a id="post-180"></a>
[180] **Private Equity Diligence Partner** Have eClerx’s FY26-Q1 filings disclosed receivables aging (>90 days), segment-wise DSO, and whether client system migrations changed payment terms versus temporary invoice holds; plus any timeline guidance to revert DSO to 80–82 days? _(🔄 10)_

<a id="post-182"></a>
[182] **AI Services Product Manager** [Strength] Bundling LLM-agnostic, audit-ready “edge” modules (PII redaction, prompt-guarding, full model logs, on‑prem inferencing) into Compliance Manager/QA360 can unlock GenAI on client networks, cutting security-approval cycles and lifting outcome-priced attach in BFSI/CMT. Mechanism: neutralizes data-risk objections. | Falsifier: No drop in security-review time/attach rate {Conf: Med} _(🔄 3)_

<a id="post-183"></a>
[183] **Sector Specialist, Fashion & Luxury BPO** Has eClerx disclosed Fashion & Luxury vertical revenue/mix and YoY trend for Q1 FY26, plus any FY26 pipeline metrics or named clients in this vertical in filings, slides, or press releases? _(🔄 9)_

[184] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: In publicly available FY26 materials (Q1 FY26 results, investor slides, press releases), what revenue and mix contribution did eClerx disclose for its Fashion & Luxury vertical in Q1 FY26, what was the year-over-year growth or decline for that vertical, and did the company disclose any FY26 pipeline metrics or named client wins in Fashion & Luxury? A: Short answer — eClerx did not disclose a numeric revenue, percentage‑mix or a vertical YoY figure for Fashion & Luxury in its public Q1 FY26 materials. Management only said the Fashion & Luxury vertical “continues to remain weak” (no dollar/% split or YoY change was published). ([zonebourse.com](https://www.zonebourse.com/cours/action/ECLERX-SERVICES-LIMITED-9059903/actualite/Transcript-EClerx-Services-Limited-Q1-2026-Earnings-Call-Jul-25-2025-50615656/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [streetinsider.com](https://www.streetinsider.com/Business%2BWire/Industry-focused%2BSpecialist%2BITITES%2BFirm%2BeClerx%2BDelivers%2BStrong%2BQ1%2BFY26%2BPerformance/25096836.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) What they did disclose: Q1 deal wins (ACV) were $32m and management said FY26 ACV is expected to exceed last year’s ~$140m — i.e., firm‑level pipeline metrics were given. No named Fashion & Luxury client wins were announced in the Q1 FY26 press release, slides or earnings transcript.

[185] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: In eClerx’s Q1 FY26 results materials or earnings call transcript, what receivables aging breakdown (including the >90 days bucket) and segment-wise Days Sales Outstanding were disclosed; what did management state about whether client invoicing system migrations changed contractual payment terms versus causing temporary invoice holds; and what timeline guidance, if any, was provided to return consolidated DSO to the historical 80–82 day range? A: Short answer: - What was disclosed: consolidated DSO rose to 86 days in Q1 FY26; management said the increase was due to some large clients migrating invoicing/purchase‑order systems that put invoices on hold (they described these as temporary holds, not changes to contractual payment terms) and said they expect DSO to revert to ~80–82 days. ([alphaspread.com](https://www.alphaspread.com/security/nse/eclerx/investor-relations/earnings-call/q1-2026?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [de.marketscreener.com](https://de.marketscreener.com/kurs/aktie/ECLERX-SERVICES-LIMITED-9059903/news/Transcript-EClerx-Services-Limited-Q1-2026-Earnings-Call-Jul-25-2025-50615656/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - What I could not find in the publicly available Q1 FY26 call or slide materials: a receivables‑aging table (showing the >90‑day bucket) and a segment‑wise DSO breakout. I reviewed the earnings‑call transcript and available summaries but the detailed aging and segmental DSO lines were not published there.

A: Short answer: - Revenue currency mix (FY26 YTD): USD ~87%, EUR ~8%, GBP ~3%, Others ~2% (eClerx’s “currency contribution” table). eClerx does not publish separate public line-item revenue percentages for INR, EGP or PEN (those appear in “Others”).

[187] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August–September 2025, what base pay and benefits are shown in eClerx’s job postings for entry-level customer experience (CX) and Know Your Customer (KYC) roles in Cairo, Egypt, and how do these figures compare with published Cairo living-wage estimates and prevailing BPO wage benchmarks including night-shift premiums and employer-provided transport? A: Short answer — sourced: - eClerx CX (entry-level Customer Care Executive, Maadi): LinkedIn job posting shows a net base salary of 15,527 EGP plus “+ Night Allowance” and a performance/KPI bonus; employer-transport is provided (door‑to‑door for females; pickup points for males). ([eg.linkedin.com](https://eg.linkedin.com/jobs/view/call-center-at-eclerx-egypt-4189988758)) - eClerx KYC (Cairo): I could not find an eClerx KYC job posting for Cairo that lists base pay/benefits (eClerx has a Cairo site but no published KYC pay advert located). (site search). ([careers.eclerx.com](https://careers.eclerx.com/)) - How that compares: the Anker/Global Living‑Wage Reference Value for urban Egypt (2024) is EGP 12,448/month — the eClerx CX base (15,527 EGP) is above that. Typical Cairo BPO offers (market job ads) show lower entry bases (~7–13k EGP) with common add‑ons: night/overnight allowances (~≈1,000–1,300 EGP) + transport and KPI bonuses.

### Round 3

<a id="post-188"></a>
[188] **Delivery Center Director, APAC** <counter: 7_0 Cairo wage/transport evidence eases your risk: eClerx’s Cairo CX job ad lists 15,527 EGP base + night allowance + employer transport (door-to-door for women), above the 2024 urban living-wage (12,448 EGP).

[190] **Quantitative Macro Strategist** [Strength] USD-heavy revenue (~87%) against predominantly INR costs, plus emerging EGP/PEN payrolls, provides FX operating leverage: softer INR/EGP/PEN vs USD can lift INR EBITDA even with flat volumes; short-tenor USD forwards smooth timing, not magnitude.

[193] **Institutional Investor Relations Specialist** <counter: 6_0 Mgmt said DSO rise stems from temporary invoice holds during client system migrations (per oracle_14), not changed payment terms; extrapolating “normalized longer terms” and buyback/M&A constraint is speculative.

[194] **Private Equity Diligence Partner** [Risk] Parent-level FCF may trail EBITDA even if DSO normalizes because cash generated in new Cairo/Lima entities can be delayed by FX liquidity, capital controls, dividend/royalty approvals, and withholding taxes; mechanism: offshore cash accumulates, slowing buybacks/M&A despite accounting profit.

Provide sources. A: Short answer: eClerx has not published a company-level, vertical‑split set of client‑onboarding cycle metrics (time‑to‑contract, time‑to‑first‑invoice, time‑to‑benefit) for FY25 or Q1 FY26. I could not find any investor presentations, annual/quarterly reports or earnings transcripts that report those metrics by vertical; public disclosures instead show related KPIs (DSO, ACV, deal wins) and isolated case‑study timelines (e.g., a Compliance‑Manager deployment “within six weeks”) but no standardized definitions or methodology for time‑to‑value.

Provide dates and public links. A: Short answer: I could not find any public FY25–FY26 disclosure from eClerx that states explicit DORA readiness/compliance for EU financial‑services clients (no public note of executed DORA contractual addenda, no third‑party “DORA” audit attestation, and no SOC report mapped to DORA requirements) in the company’s investor presentation, earnings materials or press releases I checked.

[200] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What do eClerx’s publicly available job postings or policy documents state about employer-provided transportation for employees at the Cairo, Egypt delivery center, including night-shift coverage, eligibility rules, route/zone coverage or door-to-door provisions (especially for female employees), and the effective dates? Provide public links. A: Summary: Public eClerx Egypt job listings for the Cairo (Maadi/Tech Park) delivery/call‑center role state employer transportation is provided; listings specify rotational shifts with a night allowance and "door‑to‑door for females" while males use pickup points.

[201] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: For FY25–FY26, what third-party social or labor audits or certifications (e.g., SMETA/SEDEX, SA8000, ISO 45001) and any Modern Slavery statements or ESG supplier attestations has eClerx published that explicitly cover the Cairo, Egypt, and Lima, Peru delivery centers? List audit/certificate titles, auditors or issuing bodies, certificate numbers, audit dates, scope statements (working hours, wages, freedom of association/union rights, grievance mechanisms), validity periods, and provide public links. A: Short answer (search current to Aug 15, 2025): I found no publicly‑published, site‑level third‑party social/labour audits or social‑certificates (SMETA/SEDEX, SA8000, ISO‑45001) nor a site‑specific Modern Slavery statement or supplier attestation that explicitly names or covers the Cairo (Egypt) or Lima (Peru) delivery centres for FY25–FY26. eClerx has organisation‑level ESG/BRSR disclosures (wages, grievance mechanism, freedom of association / human‑rights policies) and an ISO‑42001 AI management certification, but I found no public site certificates or audit reports that list Cairo or Lima as audited sites as of Aug 15, 2025.

[203] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What standard KPI-based service level agreement (SLA) or statement-of-work templates (if any) has eClerx published for its Analytics & Automation products—such as Compliance Manager, QA360, or Roboworx—that define outcome metrics (e.g., automation rate, accuracy uplift, cycle-time reduction) and any service credits? Provide public links, publication dates, and example thresholds; if none are published, cite any public case studies that include explicit KPI definitions. A: Short answer (search date: 15 Aug 2025): I could not find any publicly posted, downloadable SLA or SOW templates from eClerx (Compliance Manager, QA360 or Roboworx) that define binding outcome metrics or service‑credit tables. What eClerx does publish are product pages and case studies that report outcome KPIs (examples below), but those pages do not include standard SLA/SOW templates or published service‑credit thresholds. ([roboworx.eclerx.com](https://roboworx.eclerx.com/roboworx.html), [genai360.eclerx.com](https://genai360.eclerx.com/qa360_at_eclerx.html), [technology.eclerx.com](https://technology.eclerx.com/transforming-syndicated-loans-credit-agreement-management-with-eclerx-docintel/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Examples from public pages / case studies (pages typically show only product/case claims, no template or credit table): - Roboworx case summaries: 95% production coverage by bots; 65% AHT reduction; 95% chat/process automation in examples. (site shows ©2024). ([roboworx.eclerx.com](https://roboworx.eclerx.com/roboworx.html)) - QA360 product page: claims like “100% audit coverage,” “35% agent performance improvement,” “75% reduction in manual effort” (no SLA table). ([genai360.eclerx.com](https://genai360.eclerx.com/qa360_at_eclerx.html)) - DocIntel / Doc‑management case study: notes deployment “meeting strict service‑level agreements” but doesn’t publish the SLA text or credit amounts. ([technology.eclerx.com](https://technology.eclerx.com/transforming-syndicated-loans-credit-agreement-management-with-eclerx-docintel/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can (a) run a deeper crawl of archived/press/filings for any client SOWs that were publicly filed, or (b) draft a vendor‑grade SLA template (metrics + service‑credit schedule) you could use in negotiations with eClerx.

[204] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What is the source organization, methodology, and 2024 monthly amount for the Cairo urban living-wage estimate of 12,448 Egyptian pounds, including household assumptions (e.g., family size), whether figures are gross or net of taxes, and a public link to the methodology? A: Short answer - Source: Anker Research Institute (Anker Reference Value, endorsed by the Global Living Wage Coalition). ([ankerresearchinstitute.org](https://www.ankerresearchinstitute.org/s/Urban-Egypt-LW-Reference-Value_2024-FINAL-9dkx.pdf), [globallivingwage.org](https://globallivingwage.org/reference-value/living-wage-reference-value-for-urban-egypt/)) - Methodology: Anker Reference‑Value approach (multivariate regression of 40 quality‑assured Anker studies) built on the Anker living‑wage method (model diet, decent housing, “other” costs; reference family size determined per country from household/fertility/mortality and full‑time equivalent workers). Public technical description available.

[205] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: For FY23 through FY26 to date, which Fashion & Luxury clients has eClerx publicly named in case studies, press releases, or investor materials, and for each disclosure, what scope of work (e-commerce content operations, clienteling/customer experience, martech/analytics, KYC/brand protection) and any quantified outcomes were reported? Provide links and dates. A: Short answer: I could not find any public, brand‑name disclosures of specific Fashion & Luxury clients by eClerx for FY23–FY26 to date. eClerx/CLX public materials in that period refer to the sector or anonymous clients (e.g., “luxury fashion brands”, “Top‑3 global watch company”) and publish product/case outcomes but not named luxury brands. Examples (FY/date + scope + reported outcome) - eClerx Annual Report 2023‑24 (published Aug 28, 2024) — industry references to “fashion” / “Top 3 global watch company”; scope = digital / e‑commerce & analytics (no brand names or client‑level KPIs).

([genai360.eclerx.com](https://genai360.eclerx.com/casestudy_attribute_enrichment.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you’d like, I can (a) search regulatory filings, PR archives or social posts for any named fashion clients, or (b) compile every eClerx/CLX sector mention + exact wording and dates. Which do you prefer?

[206] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: Under Regulation (EU) 2022/2554 on Digital Operational Resilience (DORA), which specific Articles and related ESA regulatory or implementing technical standards (RTS/ITS) or guidelines establish requirements for 24–72 hour incident reporting, full audit/access rights, data location and exit terms, and sub-outsourcing transparency applicable to ICT third-party providers to EU financial entities? Provide citations and compliance timelines. A: Short answer—mapping to DORA and the ESA technical rules: - Incident reporting (24–72h): DORA Art.19(4) (reporting duty) + ESAs/Commission RTS/ITS: Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2025/301 (content & time‑limits: initial ≤24h; intermediate ≤72h) and Implementing Reg. (EU) 2025/302 (reporting templates/procedures). ([eur-lex.europa.eu](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32022R2554&utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Full audit / access rights: DORA Art.30(3)(e) (unrestricted access/inspection/audit rights) (also Art.28(6) re: audit frequency) and the RTS on subcontracting requiring subcontractors to grant the same rights (Commission Delegated Reg. (EU) 2025/532).

[207] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of FY26, what are the statutory withholding tax rates in Egypt and Peru on outbound dividends, royalties, and service fees paid to non-residents, including applicable rates under the India–Egypt and India–Peru tax treaties if in force, and what central bank or other regulatory approvals are required in Egypt and Peru for dividend or intercompany payment remittances? Provide citations to official regulations and treaties. A: Short answer (FY26 / as of Aug 15, 2025): - Egypt (domestic WHT): dividends to non‑residents = 10% (5% if shares listed on EGX); royalties = 20%; service/technical fees = 20%. Under the India–Egypt (UAR) DTAA: dividends are capped at 15% (treaty art.11); royalties remain taxable in the source state (treaty art.13) — treaty does not specify a lower numeric cap, so Egypt’s domestic treatment (practical WHT) applies unless bilateral relief/procedures are used. ([taxsummaries.pwc.com](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/egypt/corporate/withholding-taxes?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [incometaxindia.gov.in](https://incometaxindia.gov.in/DTAA/108690000000000094.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Peru (domestic WHT): dividends/profit distributions = 5%; royalties = 30%; general service fees = 30% (technical assistance 15% if documentary/audit conditions met). There is no India–Peru DTAA in force, so Peruvian domestic rates apply. ([taxsummaries.pwc.com](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/Peru/Corporate/Withholding-taxes?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [internacional.sunat.gob.pe](https://internacional.sunat.gob.pe/en/fiscalizacion-internacional/tributacion-de-no-domiciliados/1-impuestos-directos/11-peruvian-source?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Remittance/approval rules: - Egypt: Investment Law No.72/2017 guarantees the right to repatriate profits in convertible currency; in practice banks/CBE oversight and tax documentation (WHT payment/ETA evidence, advance‑rulings/refund procedures for treaty relief) are required. ([investmentpolicy.unctad.org](https://investmentpolicy.unctad.org/investment-laws/laws/167/egypt-investment-law-?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [eg.andersen.com](https://eg.andersen.com/withholding-taxes-in-egypt/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Peru: foreign‑exchange regime is liberal; remittances are permitted but payors must withhold/pay SUNAT tax and banks will require proof of tax payment and standard banking KYC/documentation — no central‑bank prior approval for ordinary dividend remittances. ([internacional.sunat.gob.pe](https://internacional.sunat.gob.pe/en/fiscalizacion-internacional/tributacion-de-no-domiciliados/1-impuestos-directos/11-peruvian-source?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [bcrp.gob.pe](https://www.bcrp.gob.pe/reporte-de-inflacion/62-ingles/about-the-bcrp.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want the exact treaty articles (text) or official statutory citations (Income Tax Law / Supreme Decrees / specific CBE circulars), I can attach PDFs/links.

[209] **Delivery Center Director, APAC** Has eClerx publicly disclosed Egypt PDPL cross‑border data permits (and any CBE outsourcing approvals) for Cairo, and Peru ANPDP/SBS authorizations for cross‑border BFSI/KYC processing from Lima; include document titles, IDs, dates, and scope boundaries? _(🔄 10)_

<a id="post-210"></a>
[210] **ESG Investment Analyst** [Strength] Incremental governance transparency: management added KPI/balance-sheet slides, explicitly discussed DSO drivers/timeline and made a large gratuity-fund contribution—reducing information asymmetry and signaling long-termism. Mechanism: clearer cash/working-capital narrative lowers perceived ESG/governance discount and supports capital-return credibility. | Falsifier: Q2 slides drop cash/DSO details or gratuity underfunded {Conf: Med} _(🔄 9)_

<a id="post-211"></a>
[211] **Quantitative Macro Strategist** [Strength] Follow-the-sun diversification (India+Lima+Cairo) is macro-resilience accretive: it reduces single-country outage risk, aligns with EU/UK operational-resilience expectations, and can justify stickier BFSI/KYC contracts or premium SLAs amid vendor consolidation. Mechanism: time-zone redundancy and geo failover lift win-rates and pricing power. | Falsifier: No deals cite resilience benefits {Conf: Med} _(🔄 7)_

<a id="post-212"></a>
[212] **Client-side IT Transformation Lead** Has eClerx publicly documented Egypt PDPL controller/processor registration, any CBE approvals, Peru ANPD/SBS filings or approvals, and the SCCs/BCRs/TIAs used for cross‑border KYC/CX processing from Cairo/Lima to India/EU/US, with effective dates and scopes? _(🔄 10)_

<a id="post-213"></a>
[213] **Emerging Markets Regulator** As of Aug 2025, have India’s DPDP cross‑border transfer rules (whitelist/derogations) been notified, and has eClerx publicly disclosed DPDP compliance (data transfer governance, DPO/GR officer, notices/consents) or certifications covering processing in Cairo/Lima? _(🔄 10)_

<a id="post-214"></a>
[214] **Institutional Investor Relations Specialist** [Strength] Margin-resilience is visible: Q1 EBITDA 24.8% despite ~250 bps wage impact and ~20 bps new-center drag, offset by offshore growth and bottom‑of‑pyramid hiring; plus lower top‑10 concentration and faster Emerging/Analytics growth diversify earnings—bolstering 24–28% band credibility amid consolidation. | Falsifier: Q2 EBITDA <24% despite higher revenue {Conf: Med}

<a id="post-215"></a>
[215] **Private Equity Diligence Partner** What were eClerx’s contract assets and contract liabilities at Q1 FY26 and their QoQ movement, and has management disclosed billing mix (T&M vs milestone/outcome) or unbilled DSO that would explain OCF conversion headwinds? _(🔄 10)_

[216] **Cairo Delivery Site Community Advocate** Has eClerx publicly posted Cairo-specific employee welfare policies (Arabic) covering night-shift transport, anti-harassment/grievance hotlines, overtime/rest-day rules, and social insurance enrollment; if yes, provide links and effective dates? _(🔄 10)_

<a id="post-217"></a>
[217] **AI Services Product Manager** [Strength] Shift productized IP (Compliance Manager, QA360, Market Intelligence) to usage-based pricing using in-product telemetry, converting larger ACVs into higher-frequency invoices that smooth OCF and tie fees to realized outcomes amid slower decisions; Analytics+Tech reorg speeds metering connectors. | Falsifier: No usage-based contracts by Q4 {Conf: Med}

<a id="post-218"></a>
[218] **Sector Specialist, Fashion & Luxury BPO** [Strength] Luxury softness can be backfilled by compliance‑mandated workloads: EU Digital Product Passport (ESPR) for textiles, CSRD supply‑chain data traceability, and DSA brand‑safety/moderation. Mechanism: non‑discretionary deadlines shift spend to high‑integrity product/asset data ops with auditable trails—well‑matched to eClerx’s Analytics plus Compliance Manager/QA360 (data engineering, QA, model logs). | Falsifier: No DPP/CSRD pilots disclosed FY26 {Conf: Med}

[219] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What Cairo, Egypt–specific employee welfare policies has eClerx publicly posted—covering anti-harassment and grievance hotlines, overtime and weekly rest-day rules, and social insurance enrollment—including the policy languages (Arabic and/or English), effective dates, and public links? A: Short answer — public, Cairo‑specific policies were not found. eClerx has posted global HR/ethics documents (English) that apply to all locations, but I could not find Cairo/Egypt‑only policies for overtime, weekly rest‑day, or social‑insurance enrollment on its public sites. What is publicly posted (examples): - Whistle‑Blower / Vigil Mechanism — Whistle‑Blower Policy (English), dated 01‑Apr‑2019 (public PDF referenced by eClerx). ([valueresearchonline.com](https://www.valueresearchonline.com/stories/04C61804-3AD8-46ED-92A8-2BF83E4D7F8F/news-announcement/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - Employee Relations & Human Rights Policy — HR policy PDF (posted Nov‑2023 on eClerx resources; English). The company’s BRSR/annual reporting also describes a Prevention of Sexual Harassment committee and an internal grievance process. ([valueresearchonline.com](https://www.valueresearchonline.com/stories/04C61804-3AD8-46ED-92A8-2BF83E4D7F8F/news-announcement/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [eclerx.com](https://eclerx.com/privacy-policy/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) What I did NOT find publicly: - Any Cairo/Egypt‑specific posted documents (in Arabic or English) that explicitly set overtime rules, weekly rest‑day logic for Cairo, or company‑published social‑insurance enrollment procedures. eClerx says grievance policy/details are on its intranet (not public). ([valueresearchonline.com](https://www.valueresearchonline.com/stories/04C61804-3AD8-46ED-92A8-2BF83E4D7F8F/news-announcement/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you’d like, I can (a) fetch the exact public PDF links, (b) search Arabic pages, or (c contact eClerx for confirmation.

[220] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: As of August 2025, what official notifications, rules, or guidance under India’s Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDP Act) govern cross-border personal data transfers (e.g., any notified whitelist of permitted jurisdictions or stated derogations), and what has eClerx publicly disclosed about its DPDP implementation—including the appointed Data Protection Officer and Grievance Redressal Officer, published privacy notices and consent mechanisms, and any DPDP certifications or third-party attestations—particularly for processing performed in its Cairo (Egypt) and Lima (Peru) delivery centers? Provide publication dates and public links. A: Short answer (as of 15 Aug 2025) - Government: The Centre published draft Digital Personal Data Protection Rules for consultation on 3 Jan 2025; MeitY finished the public consultation and said it is finalising rules on 28 Jul 2025. No final Rules/notification has published a government “whitelist” of permitted foreign jurisdictions or formal derogations for cross‑border transfers as of 15 Aug 2025. ([newsonair.gov.in](https://www.newsonair.gov.in/govt-releases-draft-digital-personal-data-protection-rules-to-safeguard-citizen-rights-promote-innovation/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [mondaq.com](https://www.mondaq.com/india/data-protection/1659450/india-moves-closer-to-enforcing-data-protection-law-meity-completes-review-of-public-feedback?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - eClerx public disclosures: eClerx’s corporate Privacy Policy (shows DPO contact DPO@eclerx.com) is published on its site (no named India DPDP DPO or Grievance‑Redressal Officer, and I found no DPDP‑specific certification or India transfer‑whitelist statement). eClerx has an ISO AIMS (ISO 42001:2023) certification announced 5 Feb 2025 and lists Cairo among its delivery locations; Lima presence appears in recruitment/locations but I found no public DPDP notices describing processing of Indian personal data in Cairo/Lima. ([eclerx.com](https://eclerx.com/privacy-policy/), [prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/eclerx-achieves-iso-420012023-certification-for-artificial-intelligence-management-systems-aims-302369111.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [careers.eclerx.com](https://careers.eclerx.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can (1) pull the MeitY draft rules text, (2) search for any later govt Gazette notifications through 15 Aug 2025, or (3) request/compile specific eClerx documents (privacy notice snapshots, SOC/ISO reports) and where they mention cross‑border processing.

[221] **Research Agent** 🔍 Q: What amounts did eClerx report for contract assets and contract liabilities as of Q1 FY26, what were their quarter-over-quarter changes versus Q4 FY25, and has management disclosed the billing mix by model (time-and-materials versus milestone/outcome-based) or an unbilled Days Sales Outstanding metric that could explain the lower operating cash flow conversion in Q1 FY26? Provide sources. A: Short answer (Q1 FY26 / quarter ended Jun 30, 2025): - I could not find line‑item amounts for “contract assets” (unbilled revenue) or “contract liabilities” (deferred revenue) reported in the company’s Q1 FY26 earnings summary or call — those figures appear only in the detailed consolidated financial statements/quarterly filing (not in the headline press release / slides I checked). (So I did not infer non‑existence; the numbers likely exist in the Q1 financial statements but weren’t put in the press release text/slide deck I reviewed). ([marketscreener.com](https://www.marketscreener.com/news/eclerx-services-limited-reports-earnings-results-for-the-first-quarter-ended-june-30-2025-ce7c5fdad98ff320), [advisor.valueresearchonline.com](https://advisor.valueresearchonline.com/stories/1DDB102C-EF18-4656-AC7F-31A3862A922F/news-announcement/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) - What management did disclose: net operating cash flow = INR 223 mn and DSO rose to 86 days (from 80 days), which management said (in the Q1 call) caused the weaker operating cash‑flow conversion; they also called out a large gratuity contribution and Q1 bonus timing. No split of billing by T&M vs milestone/outcome nor an “unbilled‑DSO” metric was given on the call. ([alphaspread.com](https://www.alphaspread.com/security/nse/eclerx/investor-relations/earnings-call/q1-2026?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [zonebourse.com](https://www.zonebourse.com/cours/action/ECLERX-SERVICES-LIMITED-9059903/actualite/Transcript-EClerx-Services-Limited-Q1-2026-Earnings-Call-Jul-25-2025-50615656/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) If you want, I can fetch the company’s Q1 FY26 consolidated financials (PDF) and extract the contract‑assets and contract‑liabilities amounts and QoQ movements.
